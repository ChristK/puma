Traditional surveillance methods tend to detect point-source outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting; they are less effective at identifying low-level and intermittent food supply contamination. Furthermore, it can take up to 9 weeks for infections to be confirmed, reducing slow-burn outbreak recognition, potentially impacting hundreds or thousands of people over wide geographical areas. There is a need to address fundamental problems in traditional diarrheal disease surveillance because of underreporting and subsequent unconfirmed infection by patients and general practitioners (GPs); varying submission practices and selective testing of samples in laboratories; limitations in traditional microbiological diagnostics, meaning that the timeliness of sample testing and etiology of most cases remains unknown; and poorly integrated human and animal surveillance systems, meaning that identification of zoonoses is delayed or missed.', 'This study aims to detect anomalous patterns in the incidence of gastrointestinal disease in the (human) community; to target sampling; to test traditional diagnostic methods against rapid, modern, and sensitive molecular and genomic microbiology methods that identify and characterize responsible pathogens rapidly and more completely; and to determine the cost-effectiveness of rapid, modern, sensitive molecular and genomic microbiology methods.', \"Syndromic surveillance will be used to aid identification of anomalous patterns in microbiological events based on temporal associations, demographic similarities among patients and animals, and changes in trends in acute gastroenteritis cases using a point process statistical model. Stool samples will be obtained from patients' consulting GPs, to improve the timeliness of cluster detection and characterize the pathogens responsible, allowing health protection professionals to investigate and control outbreaks quickly, limiting their size and impact.

They do this by studying the effects that treatments have on patients by measuring outcomes, such as pain and quality of life. Often research teams measure different outcomes even though each team is studying the same condition. This makes it hard to compare the findings from different studies and it can reduce the accuracy of the treatment advice available to patients. Increasingly, researchers are tackling this problem by developing 'core outcome sets'. These are lists of outcomes that all researchers working on a given condition should measure in their studies. It is important that patients have a voice in the development of core outcome sets and children and young people are no exception. But their voices have rarely been heard when core outcome sets are developed. Researchers are trying to address this problem and make sure that core outcome sets are developed in ways that are suitable for children and young people. As a first step, we held two international workshops with children and young people to listen to their views. They emphasised the importance of motivating young people to participate in developing core outcome sets, making them feel valued, and making the development process more interactive, enjoyable and convenient. We hope this commentary will encourage researchers to include children and young people when developing core outcome sets and to adapt their methods so these are suitable for young participants. Future research is important to examine whether these adaptations are effective.\", \"&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; Different research teams looking at treatments for the same condition often select and measure inconsistent treatment outcomes. This makes it difficult to synthesise the results of different studies, leads to selective outcome reporting and impairs the quality of evidence about treatments. 'Core outcome sets' (COS) can help to address these problems. A COS is an agreed, minimum list of outcomes that researchers are encouraged to consistently measure and report in their studies. Including children and young people (CYP) as participants in the development of COS for paediatric conditions ensures that clinically meaningful outcomes are measured and reported. However, few published COS have included CYP as participants. COS developers have described difficulties in recruiting and retaining CYP and there is a lack of guidance on optimising COS methods for them. We aimed to explore CYP's views on the methods used to develop COS and identify ways to optimise these methods.&lt;b&gt;Main body&lt;/b&gt; This commentary summarises discussions during two workshops with approximately 70 CYP (aged 10-18\\u2009years old) at the International Children's Advisory Network Research and Advocacy Summit, 2018. Delegates described what might motivate them to participate in a COS study, including feeling valued, understanding the need for COS and the importance of input from CYP in their development, and financial and other incentives (e.g. certificates of participation). For Delphi surveys, delegates suggested that lists of outcomes should be as brief as possible, and that scoring and feedback methods should be simplified. For consensus meetings, delegates advised preparing CYP in advance, supporting them during meetings (e.g. via mentors) and favoured arrangements whereby CYP could meet separately from parents and other stakeholders. Overall, they wanted COS methods that were convenient, enjoyable and engaging.&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; This commentary points to the limitations of the methods currently used to develop COS with CYP. It also points to ways to motivate CYP to participate in COS studies and to enhancements of methods to make participation more engaging for CYP. Pending much needed research on COS methods for CYP, the perspectives offered in the workshops should help teams developing COS in paediatrics and child health.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sherratt F"}, {"clean": "Bagley H"}, {"clean": "Stones S"}, {"clean": "Preston J"}, {"clean": "Hall N"}, {"clean": "Gorst S"}, {"clean": "Young B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Res Involv Engagem", "volume": "6", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "2JL865RJ", "DOI": "10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.07.004", "DOI_filename": "27c35c483cc550d90b6be519312cef39", "PMID": "30015244", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85049800847", "hash": "bb82b4055f3dae596335ea4abbc61f13"}, "clean": {"title": "Quantifying life: Understanding the history of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs).", "abstract": "[\"Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) are central to healthcare decision-making in Britain and abroad, yet their history is poorly understood.

Using a participatory approach, a standardised adult UHI survey questionnaire was developed mainly comprised of previously validated questions, followed by translation and back-translation. An evidence-based survey methodology with extensive training was employed to ensure standardised data collection. Comprehensive UK piloting ensured face validity and investigated the potential for response bias in the surveys. Each urban area distributed 800 questionnaires to age-sex stratified random samples of adults following the survey protocols. Piloting revealed lower response rates in younger males from more deprived areas. Almost 19500 adult UHI questionnaires were returned and entered from participating urban areas. Response rates were generally low but varied across Europe. The participatory approach in development of survey questionnaires and methods using an evidence-based approach and extensive training of partners has ensured comparable UHI data across heterogeneous European contexts. The data provide unique information on health and determinants of health in adults living in European urban areas that could be used to inform urban health policymaking. However, piloting has revealed a concern that non-response bias could lead to under-representation of younger males from more deprived areas. This could affect the generalisability of findings from the adult surveys given the low response rates.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Europe", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Status Indicators", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Health Surveys", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Urban Health", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Urban Population", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pope D"}, {"clean": "Puzzolo E"}, {"clean": "Birt C"}, {"clean": "Guha J"}, {"clean": "Higgerson J"}, {"clean": "Patterson L"}, {"clean": "van Ameijden E"}, {"clean": "Steels S"}, {"clean": "Owusu M"}, {"clean": "Bruce N"}, {"clean": "Verma A"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Eur J Public Health", "volume": "27", "issue": "suppl_2"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "2YC6546S", "DOI": "10.1057/sth.2014.13", "DOI_filename": "bb04e1f58a2234a2ae9aa7a26221f318", "PMID": "24447810", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84898905846", "hash": "1e120d72605184bed38ddb88bf5a1de0"}, "clean": {"title": "Comparison of type 2 diabetes prevalence estimates in Saudi Arabia from a validated Markov model against the International Diabetes Federation and other modelling studies.", "abstract": "['To compare the estimates and projections of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevalence in Saudi Arabia from a validated Markov model against other modelling estimates, such as those produced by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project.', 'A discrete-state Markov model was developed and validated that integrates data on population, obesity and smoking prevalence trends in adult Saudis aged \u226525 years to estimate the trends in T2DM prevalence (annually from 1992 to 2022).

Cells possess enzymes called molecular dioxygenases that depend on oxygen for activity. A subclass of molecular dioxygenases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor-independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells.

We investigated the chromatin landscape of SUMO-2 modifications in response to heat stress. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing, we showed that in response to heat shock, SUMO-2 accumulated at nucleosome-depleted, active DNA regulatory elements, which represented binding sites for large protein complexes and were predominantly associated with active genes. However, SUMO did not act as a direct transcriptional repressor or activator of these genes during heat shock. Instead, integration of our results with published proteomics data on heat shock-induced SUMO-2 substrates supports a model in which the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins acts as an acute stress response that is required for the stability of protein complexes involved in gene expression and posttranscriptional modification of mRNA. We showed that the conjugation of SUMO-2 to chromatin-associated proteins is an integral component of the proteotoxic stress response, and propose that SUMO-2 fulfills its essential role in cell survival by contributing to the maintenance of protein complex homeostasis.

The most recent study of survival in the UK is by Dodge and colleagues (2007), who used data obtained from CF clinics and the national death register, and gave an estimate of survival for babies born in 2003. We found no previous studies that have obtained detailed information on survival using UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry data. Jackson and colleagues obtained survival estimates for the US and Ireland using registry data (Jackson et al., 2011). MacKenzie and colleagues used US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry data from 2000 to 2010 to project survival for children born and diagnosed with CF in 2010, accounting for sex, genotype and age at diagnosis (MacKenzie et al., 2014). Previous studies on estimated survival in CF have become out of date or have not accounted for the full range of patient characteristics available at birth. Few have presented conditional survival estimates (Dodge et al., 2007). Added value of this study This is the first study to yield detailed survival statistics using the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry, which is one of the largest national CF registries outside of the US and has almost complete coverage of the UK CF population. The primary goal was to leverage the long-term follow-up of the nearly complete UK CF population available in the Registry for the purposes of producing accurate, precise predictions in the modern era of CF care. Estimates are presented from birth and conditional on survival to older ages. These are the first conditional estimates in CF to also account for genotype, sex and age at diagnosis, which were each included in the modelling using a flexible approach. Projections are also provided under different scenarios based on downward trends in mortality rates. Our use of flexible parametric survival models is novel in this field, and our approach could be used to provide modern survival statistics for other chronic diseases and disorders. Implications of all the available evidence Our estimates of future survival in CF under a range of different scenarios are based on data on nearly all individuals living with the disease in the UK in recent times, reflective of a modern era of care, and are most appropriate for the families of babies being born in the present day with CF. Conditional estimates inform patients who have already reached an older age, and their clinicians. Over half of babies born today, and of individuals aged 30years and above alive today, can expect to survive into their fifth decade. Insights based on our survival projections can be used to inform future needs in CF health care provision.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cystic Fibrosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Life Expectancy", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Registries", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Survival Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Survival Rate", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Keogh R"}, {"clean": "Szczesniak R"}, {"clean": "Taylor-Robinson D"}, {"clean": "Bilton D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Cyst Fibros", "volume": "17", "issue": "2"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "3QBSVXEW", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.i2793", "DOI_filename": "6c58ec4cc65170031f17edeb67ae101c", "PMID": "27279346", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84974705184", "hash": "858824fc49951cc645041bc08bf785d6"}, "clean": {"title": "Cardiovascular screening to reduce the burden from cardiovascular disease: microsimulation study to quantify policy options.", "abstract": "['\\xa0To estimate the potential impact of universal screening for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (National Health Service Health Checks) on disease burden and socioeconomic inequalities in health in England, and to compare universal screening with alternative feasible strategies.', '\\xa0Microsimulation study of a close-to-reality synthetic population.

To address the problems of energy security, deforestation and pollution the government has developed a strategy (Masterplan) to increase use of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 12% to 58% by 2030. As a clean fuel scaled adoption of LPG has the potential to make significant positive impacts on population health. The LPG Adoption in Cameroon Evaluation (LACE) studies are assessing in the community (i) barriers and enablers for and (ii) local interventions to support, adoption and sustained use of LPG. A census survey conducted for LACE in rural and peri-urban regions of SW Cameroon provided an opportunity to investigate current fuel use patterns and factors associated with primary and exclusive use of LPG. A cross-sectional survey of 1577 households (1334 peri-urban and 243 rural) was conducted in March 2016 using standardised fuel use and household socio-demographic questions, administered by trained fieldworkers. Wood (40.7%) and LPG (51.1%) were the most frequently reported fuels, although the dominant fuels in rural and peri-urban communities were wood (81%) and LPG (58%) respectively. Fuel stacking was observed for the majority of LPG using households (91% of peri-urban and 99% of rural households). In rural homes, a higher level of education, access to sanitation and piped water and household wealth (income and asset ownership) were all significantly associated with LPG use (p\\xa0&lt;\\xa00.05). In peri-urban homes, younger age, access to sanitation and piped water and increasing education were significantly associated with both any and exclusive use of LPG (p\\xa0&lt;\\xa00.05). However, whilst household wealth was related to any LPG use, there was no relationship with exclusive use. Results from this census survey of a relatively well-established LPG market with lower levels of poverty and high levels of education than Cameroon as a whole, find LPG usage well below target levels set by the Cameroon government (58% by 2030). Fuel stacking is an issue for the majority of LPG using households. Whilst, as observed here, education, household wealth and socio-economic status are well recognised predictors of adoption and sustained use of clean modern fuels, it is important to consider factors across the whole LPG eco-system when developing policies to support their scaled expansion. A comprehensive approach is therefore required to ensure implementation of the Cameroon LPG Masterplan achieves its aspirational adoption target within its stated timeframe.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cameroon", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cooking", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Cross-Sectional Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Petroleum", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Poverty", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Rural Population", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Suburban Population", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pope D"}, {"clean": "Bruce N"}, {"clean": "Higgerson J"}, {"clean": "Hyseni L"}, {"clean": "Ronzi S"}, {"clean": "Stanistreet D"}, {"clean": "MBatchou B"}, {"clean": "Puzzolo E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Ecohealth", "volume": "15", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "4NTSM6UE", "DOI": "10.1922/CDH_3928Arheiam07", "DOI_filename": "6999ba55a44b4930f573af7ba908c5b8", "PMID": "28537363", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85004011448", "hash": "2ce373e8951f657a7de625fb33348f4b"}, "clean": {"title": "The use of diet diaries in general dental practice in England.", "abstract": "['Diet diaries are recommended as a tool to support behaviour change in dental patients at high risk of dental diseases.

They do this by studying the effects that treatments have on patients by measuring outcomes, such as pain and quality of life. Often research teams measure different outcomes even though each team is studying the same condition. This makes it hard to compare the findings from different studies and it can reduce the accuracy of the treatment advice available to patients. Increasingly, researchers are tackling this problem by developing 'core outcome sets'. These are lists of outcomes that all researchers working on a given condition should measure in their studies. It is important that patients have a voice in the development of core outcome sets and children and young people are no exception. But their voices have rarely been heard when core outcome sets are developed. Researchers are trying to address this problem and make sure that core outcome sets are developed in ways that are suitable for children and young people. As a first step, we held two international workshops with children and young people to listen to their views. They emphasised the importance of motivating young people to participate in developing core outcome sets, making them feel valued, and making the development process more interactive, enjoyable and convenient. We hope this commentary will encourage researchers to include children and young people when developing core outcome sets and to adapt their methods so these are suitable for young participants. Future research is important to examine whether these adaptations are effective.\", \"&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; Different research teams looking at treatments for the same condition often select and measure inconsistent treatment outcomes. This makes it difficult to synthesise the results of different studies, leads to selective outcome reporting and impairs the quality of evidence about treatments. 'Core outcome sets' (COS) can help to address these problems. A COS is an agreed, minimum list of outcomes that researchers are encouraged to consistently measure and report in their studies. Including children and young people (CYP) as participants in the development of COS for paediatric conditions ensures that clinically meaningful outcomes are measured and reported. However, few published COS have included CYP as participants. COS developers have described difficulties in recruiting and retaining CYP and there is a lack of guidance on optimising COS methods for them. We aimed to explore CYP's views on the methods used to develop COS and identify ways to optimise these methods.&lt;b&gt;Main body&lt;/b&gt; This commentary summarises discussions during two workshops with approximately 70 CYP (aged 10-18\\u2009years old) at the International Children's Advisory Network Research and Advocacy Summit, 2018. Delegates described what might motivate them to participate in a COS study, including feeling valued, understanding the need for COS and the importance of input from CYP in their development, and financial and other incentives (e.g. certificates of participation). For Delphi surveys, delegates suggested that lists of outcomes should be as brief as possible, and that scoring and feedback methods should be simplified. For consensus meetings, delegates advised preparing CYP in advance, supporting them during meetings (e.g. via mentors) and favoured arrangements whereby CYP could meet separately from parents and other stakeholders. Overall, they wanted COS methods that were convenient, enjoyable and engaging.&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; This commentary points to the limitations of the methods currently used to develop COS with CYP. It also points to ways to motivate CYP to participate in COS studies and to enhancements of methods to make participation more engaging for CYP.

Habit theory identifies that behaviours become habitual when they are undertaken repeatedly in response to a particular cue within a stable context. Once behaviour becomes automatic, long-term maintenance is more likely even if motivation wanes. Establishing toothbrushing as a habitual behaviour is therefore an intervention strategy which may help reduce health inequalities.

Eighty-five adults with epilepsy were recruited from three London EDs with similar catchment populations. Forty-one PWE recruited from two EDs received treatment-as-usual (TAU) and formed the comparison group. The remaining 44 PWE were recruited from the ED of a hospital that had implemented a new ENS service for PWE attending ED. These participants formed the intervention group. They were offered 2 one-to-one sessions with an ENS, plus TAU. Participants completed questionnaires on health service use and psychosocial well-being at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Covariates were identified and adjustments made. Sixty-nine (81%) participants were retained at follow-up. No significant effect of the intervention on ED visits at 12 months or on other outcomes was found. However, due to less time as inpatients, the average service cost for intervention participants over follow-up was less than for TAU participants' (adjusted difference \u00a3558, 95% CI, -\u00a32409, \u00a3648). Covariates most predictive of subsequent ED visits were patients' baseline feelings of stigmatization due to epilepsy and low confidence in managing epilepsy. The intervention did not lead to a reduction in ED use, but did not cost more, partly because those receiving the intervention had shorter hospital admissions. Our findings on long-term ED predictors clarifies what causes ED use, and suggests that future interventions might focus more on patients' perceptions of stigma and on their confidence in managing epilepsy. If addressed, ED visits might be reduced and efficiency-savings generated. \"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Disease Management", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Emergency Service, Hospital", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epilepsy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hospitalization", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nurse Clinicians", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Self Care", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Noble A"}, {"clean": "McCrone P"}, {"clean": "Seed P"}, {"clean": "Goldstein L"}, {"clean": "Ridsdale L"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS One", "volume": "9", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "6SKU63Q5", "DOI": "10.1080/13645579.2015.1068010", "DOI_filename": "17f49d4b3bbc40b760f9c7c45418d594", "PMID": "31398772", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85070260530", "hash": "e682251a7938b2cf1abc06dc557689a9"}, "clean": {"title": "Socio-economic differences in patient participation behaviours in doctor-patient interactions-A systematic mapping review of the literature.", "abstract": "['The degree to which patients participate in their care can have a positive impact on health outcomes.

Many informants across all groups felt that training PPI contributors was unnecessary because they already possessed the skills needed. Informants were also concerned that training would professionalise PPI contributors, limiting their ability to provide an authentic patient perspective. However, informants welcomed informal induction 'conversations' to help contributors understand their roles and support them in voicing their opinions.

Pump flow and pressure measurements, temperature and RH, GPS coordinates and semi-quantitative continuous particle mass concentrations based on filter differential pressure are uploaded to a central server automatically whenever the mobile phone is connected to the internet, with sampled data automatically screened for quality control parameters. A short survey is administered during the 48-h monitoring period. Post-weighed filters are further analyzed to estimate black carbon concentrations through a semi-automated, rapid, cost-effective image analysis approach. The measured PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; data will then be combined with PURE survey information on household characteristics and behaviours collected at baseline and during follow-up to develop quantitative HAP models for PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposures for all rural PURE participants (~50,000) and across different cooking fuel types within the 10 index countries.

The research shows that REAT 2.0 is a reliable, easy-to-use instrument and that most underlying constructs can be validated against residents' own neighborhood perceptions. The convergent validity of the instrument, which was tested against digital map data, can be improved for a number of miscellaneous urban form items.

It has long been perceived as a failure. This article draws on archival records and a witness seminar held in November 2016 to provide a more nuanced assessment of the 1974 reorganisation and understand more fully why it took the form that it did. In particular it identifies the reorganisation as an important moment in the ongoing story of management consultants engaging with health policymakers, and explores the role of McKinsey and Co. in detail for the first time. Key explanatory factors for their involvement are identified, including the perceived lack of expertise and manpower inside the civil service and the NHS, and perceptions of their impact and effectiveness are discussed. Many debates about the use of management consultants today were directly foreshadowed during the early 1970s. Alongside this, the role of other groups of policy actors, including civil servants, politicians and medical professionals, are established and the extent to which British health policymakers have had to work within existing cultural, political, legislative and practical constraints when trying to initiate change is demonstrated. The fact that many of the 'mistakes' that were made have been repeated in the course of subsequent reforms, speaks to the poor institutional memory of Whitehall, and the Department of Health and Social Care in particular.

Longitudinal data were taken from the British Household Panel Survey. We compared the health effects of higher wages on recipients of the minimum wage with otherwise similar persons who were likely unaffected because (1) their wages were between 100 and 110% of the eligibility threshold or (2) their firms did not increase wages to meet the threshold.

However, when it comes to participation and inclusion in taking action and making decisions, the field is characterised by conceptual confusion. This risks undermining the impact of these initiatives. While participation and inclusion are necessary conditions for empowerment and collective control, they are not necessarily sufficient. Sufficiency requires attention to the breadth of participation (i.e., to inclusion) and to the depth of participation (i.e., the extent to which it is experienced as empowering and ultimately enables the exercise of collective control over decisions and actions). In observing how different Big Local resident-led partnerships across England are tackling the day-to-day challenges of engaging with their communities, we reveal the potential for policy and practice of reframing, and therefore clarifying (to highlight the different roles they have) the concepts of participation and inclusion in terms of depth and breadth.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Community Networks", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Community Participation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Policy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Status Disparities", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Public Policy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Residence Characteristics", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Social Support", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Vulnerable Populations", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Lewis S"}, {"clean": "Bambra C"}, {"clean": "Barnes A"}, {"clean": "Collins M"}, {"clean": "Egan M"}, {"clean": "Halliday E"}, {"clean": "Orton L"}, {"clean": "Ponsford R"}, {"clean": "Powell K"}, {"clean": "Salway S"}, {"clean": "Townsend A"}, {"clean": "Whitehead M"}, {"clean": "Popay J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Health Soc Care Community", "volume": "27", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "7GUD7ILY", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30114-8", "DOI_filename": "da8848f1c4898939d19d2f478e553495", "PMID": "29119644", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85037606776", "hash": "bb7967e25c7245cc250d1a2f95b60c5b"}, "clean": {"title": "Suicide amongst people with intellectual disability: An Australian online study of disability support staff experiences and perceptions.", "abstract": "['Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) have a higher likelihood of exposure to identified risk factors for suicide when compared with the general community and have been recognised as being both capable of forming intent for suicide and acting on this intent.

They do this by studying the effects that treatments have on patients by measuring outcomes, such as pain and quality of life. Often research teams measure different outcomes even though each team is studying the same condition. This makes it hard to compare the findings from different studies and it can reduce the accuracy of the treatment advice available to patients. Increasingly, researchers are tackling this problem by developing 'core outcome sets'. These are lists of outcomes that all researchers working on a given condition should measure in their studies. It is important that patients have a voice in the development of core outcome sets and children and young people are no exception. But their voices have rarely been heard when core outcome sets are developed. Researchers are trying to address this problem and make sure that core outcome sets are developed in ways that are suitable for children and young people. As a first step, we held two international workshops with children and young people to listen to their views. They emphasised the importance of motivating young people to participate in developing core outcome sets, making them feel valued, and making the development process more interactive, enjoyable and convenient. We hope this commentary will encourage researchers to include children and young people when developing core outcome sets and to adapt their methods so these are suitable for young participants. Future research is important to examine whether these adaptations are effective.\", \"&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; Different research teams looking at treatments for the same condition often select and measure inconsistent treatment outcomes. This makes it difficult to synthesise the results of different studies, leads to selective outcome reporting and impairs the quality of evidence about treatments. 'Core outcome sets' (COS) can help to address these problems. A COS is an agreed, minimum list of outcomes that researchers are encouraged to consistently measure and report in their studies. Including children and young people (CYP) as participants in the development of COS for paediatric conditions ensures that clinically meaningful outcomes are measured and reported. However, few published COS have included CYP as participants. COS developers have described difficulties in recruiting and retaining CYP and there is a lack of guidance on optimising COS methods for them. We aimed to explore CYP's views on the methods used to develop COS and identify ways to optimise these methods.&lt;b&gt;Main body&lt;/b&gt; This commentary summarises discussions during two workshops with approximately 70 CYP (aged 10-18\\u2009years old) at the International Children's Advisory Network Research and Advocacy Summit, 2018. Delegates described what might motivate them to participate in a COS study, including feeling valued, understanding the need for COS and the importance of input from CYP in their development, and financial and other incentives (e.g. certificates of participation). For Delphi surveys, delegates suggested that lists of outcomes should be as brief as possible, and that scoring and feedback methods should be simplified. For consensus meetings, delegates advised preparing CYP in advance, supporting them during meetings (e.g. via mentors) and favoured arrangements whereby CYP could meet separately from parents and other stakeholders.

Globally, there were 3.5 billion cases (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI], 3.2 to 3.7 billion) of oral conditions, of which 2.3 billion (95% UI, 2.1 to 2.5 billion) had untreated caries in permanent teeth, 796 million (95% UI, 671 to 930 million) had severe periodontitis, 532 million (95% UI, 443 to 622 million) had untreated caries in deciduous teeth, 267 million (95% UI, 235 to 300 million) had total tooth loss, and 139 million (95% UI, 133 to 146 million) had other oral conditions in 2017. Several patterns emerged when the World Bank's classification of economies and the Socio-demographic Index were used as indicators of economic development. In general, more economically developed countries have the lowest burden of untreated dental caries and severe periodontitis and the highest burden of total tooth loss. The findings offer an opportunity for policy makers to identify successful oral health strategies and strengthen them; introduce and monitor different approaches where oral diseases are increasing; plan integration of oral health in the agenda for prevention of noncommunicable diseases; and estimate the cost of providing universal coverage for dental care.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Dental Caries", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Global Burden of Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Global Health", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Incidence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mouth Diseases", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Prevalence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Bernabe E"}, {"clean": "Marcenes W"}, {"clean": "Hernandez C"}, {"clean": "Bailey J"}, {"clean": "Abreu L"}, {"clean": "Alipour V"}, {"clean": "Amini S"}, {"clean": "Arabloo J"}, {"clean": "Arefi Z"}, {"clean": "Arora A"}, {"clean": "Ayanore M"}, {"clean": "B\u00e4rnighausen T"}, {"clean": "Bijani A"}, {"clean": "Cho D"}, {"clean": "Chu D"}, {"clean": "Crowe C"}, {"clean": "Demoz G"}, {"clean": "Demsie D"}, {"clean": "Dibaji Forooshani Z"}, {"clean": "Du M"}, {"clean": "El Tantawi M"}, {"clean": "Fischer F"}, {"clean": "Folayan M"}, {"clean": "Futran N"}, {"clean": "Geramo Y"}, {"clean": "Haj-Mirzaian A"}, {"clean": "Hariyani N"}, {"clean": "Hasanzadeh A"}, {"clean": "Hassanipour S"}, {"clean": "Hay S"}, {"clean": "Hole M"}, {"clean": "Hostiuc S"}, {"clean": "Ilic M"}, {"clean": "James S"}, {"clean": "Kalhor R"}, {"clean": "Kemmer L"}, {"clean": "Keramati M"}, {"clean": "Khader Y"}, {"clean": "Kisa S"}, {"clean": "Kisa A"}, {"clean": "Koyanagi A"}, {"clean": "Lalloo R"}, {"clean": "Le Nguyen Q"}, {"clean": "London S"}, {"clean": "Manohar N"}, {"clean": "Massenburg B"}, {"clean": "Mathur M"}, {"clean": "Meles H"}, {"clean": "Mestrovic T"}, {"clean": "Mohammadian-Hafshejani A"}, {"clean": "Mohammadpourhodki R"}, {"clean": "Mokdad A"}, {"clean": "Morrison S"}, {"clean": "Nazari J"}, {"clean": "Nguyen T"}, {"clean": "Nguyen C"}, {"clean": "Nixon M"}, {"clean": "Olagunju T"}, {"clean": "Pakshir K"}, {"clean": "Pathak M"}, {"clean": "Rabiee N"}, {"clean": "Rafiei A"}, {"clean": "Ramezanzadeh K"}, {"clean": "Rios-Blancas M"}, {"clean": "Roro E"}, {"clean": "Sabour S"}, {"clean": "Samy A"}, {"clean": "Sawhney M"}, {"clean": "Schwendicke F"}, {"clean": "Shaahmadi F"}, {"clean": "Shaikh M"}, {"clean": "Stein C"}, {"clean": "Tovani-Palone M"}, {"clean": "Tran B"}, {"clean": "Unnikrishnan B"}, {"clean": "Vu G"}, {"clean": "Vukovic A"}, {"clean": "Warouw T"}, {"clean": "Zaidi Z"}, {"clean": "Zhang Z"}, {"clean": "Kassebaum N"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Dent Res", "volume": "99", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "8G7YP58X", "DOI": "10.1111/pedi.12897", "DOI_filename": "6ab03e1892e06a5de65b055c69756533", "PMID": "31329349", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85073081423", "hash": "1dee4c4ba410077ba47ae420b5ed0af3"}, "clean": {"title": "Inequalities in glycemic control in childhood onset type 2 diabetes in England and Wales-A national population-based longitudinal study.", "abstract": "['Not much is known about glycaemic-control trajectories in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The prevalence of chronic pain among the general Canadian population increased by almost 4.0% (to 21.0%) in 2011/2012, after being in the range of 15.7 to 17.2% from 2000 to 2009/2010.

Eighteen mothers with young children who had recently experienced a gastrointestinal infection were recruited from two socioeconomically contrasting neighbourhoods in North West of England. The findings demonstrated that GI infections were particularly disruptive: experienced as disgusting, laborious and stressful and significantly impacted normal family routines. Women felt burdened by the heavy physical and emotional demands of caring for a GI infection, resulting in feelings of isolation and insufficient support in their caring role from male partners. Tensions also arose from interactions with external community organisations, particularly in complying with their regulations on infection which often undermined caregivers knowledge and expertise of what was best for their children.

For each context we quantified the performance of a complete case analysis and seven multiple imputation methods which deleted cases with missing outcome before imputation, after imputation or not at all; included or did not include the outcome in the imputation models; and included or did not include a secondary outcome in the imputation models. Methods were compared on mean absolute error, bias, coverage and power over 1,000 datasets for each scenario.', 'Overall, there was very little to separate multiple imputation methods which included the outcome in the imputation model. Even when missingness was quite extensive, all multiple imputation approaches performed well. Incorporating a secondary outcome, moderately correlated with the outcome of interest, made very little difference. The dataset size and the extent of missingness affected performance, as expected. Multiple imputation methods protected less well against missingness not at random, but did offer some protection.', 'As long as the outcome is included in the imputation model, there are very small performance differences between the possible multiple imputation approaches: no outcome imputation, imputation or imputation and deletion.

We explored patients' compliance with diet-diaries usage in a paediatric clinic within a teaching hospital setting, where remuneration is not an issue. Objectives were to investigate associated factors affecting diet diaries return rate and the information obtained from returned diaries.Methods A retrospective study of 200 randomly selected clinical records of children aged 5-11 years who had received diet analysis and advice as part of a preventive dental care programme at a dental teaching hospital between 2010 and 2013. Clinical records, with a preventive care pro forma, were included in the study. Data on social and family history, DMFT-dmft, oral hygiene practices, dental attendance and dietary habits were obtained and compared with information given in completed diet-diaries. A deductive content analysis of returned diet-diaries was undertaken using a pre-developed coding scheme.Results Of 174 complete records included in this study, diet diaries were returned in 60 (34.5%) of them. Diet diaries were more likely to be returned by those children who reported that they regularly brushed their teeth (P &lt;0.05), and those who came from smaller families (P &lt;0.05). Content analysis of diet diaries enabled the identification of harmful types of foods and drinks in 100% of diaries. General dietary issues, frequency and between-meals intake of sugars were also all captured in the majority of diaries (95.0%, N = 56). Information on sugar amount (53.0%, N = 32), prolonged-contact with teeth (57.0%, N = 34) and near bedtime intakes (17.0%, N = 28) was reported in fewer diaries.Conclusions The return rate of diet-diaries in this setting was low, and associated with patients' demographic and oral health characteristics.

This paper describes a developing toolkit to support clinical trials teams to undertake effective and meaningful PPI. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; The first phase in developing the toolkit was to describe which PPI activities should be considered in the pathway of a clinical trial and at what stage these activities should take place. This pathway was informed through review of the type and timing of PPI activities within trials coordinated by the Clinical Trials Research Centre and previously described areas of potential PPI impact in trials. In the second phase, key websites around PPI and identification of resources opportunistically, e.g. in conversation with other trialists or social media, were used to identify resources. Tools were developed where gaps existed. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; A flowchart was developed describing PPI activities that should be considered in the clinical trial pathway and the point at which these activities should happen. Three toolkit domains were identified: planning PPI; supporting PPI; recording and evaluating PPI. Four main activities and corresponding tools were identified under the planning for PPI: developing a plan; identifying patient and public contributors; allocating appropriate costs; and managing expectations. In supporting PPI, tools were developed to review participant information sheets. These tools, which require a summary of potential trial participant characteristics and circumstances help to clarify requirements and expectations of PPI review. For recording and evaluating PPI, the planned PPI interventions should be monitored in terms of impact, and a tool to monitor public contributor experience is in development. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions&lt;/b&gt; This toolkit provides a developing 'off the shelf' resource to support trial teams with limited resources in undertaking PPI.

Using the context of UK cohort studies, we define data curation debt-describing examples and their potential impact. We highlight that accruing this debt can make it more difficult to use the data in the future. Additionally, the long-running nature of cohort studies means that interest is accrued on this debt and compounded over time-increasing the impact a debt could have on a study and its stakeholders. Primary causes of data curation debt are discussed across three categories: longevity of hardware, software and data formats; funding; and skills shortages. Based on cross-domain best practice, strategies to reduce the debt and preventive measures are proposed-with importance given to the recognition and transparent reporting of data curation debt. Describing the debt in this way, we encapsulate a multi-faceted issue in simple terms understandable by all cohort study stakeholders.

Dietary salt intake remains much higher than recommended, increasing blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and stomach cancer. Substantial reductions in salt intake are therefore urgently needed. However, the debate continues about the most effective approaches. To inform future prevention programmes, we systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of possible salt reduction interventions. We further compared \"downstream, agentic\" approaches targeting individuals with \"upstream, structural\" policy-based population strategies.', 'We searched six electronic databases (CDSR, CRD, MEDLINE, SCI, SCOPUS and the Campbell Library) using a pre-piloted search strategy focussing on the effectiveness of population interventions to reduce salt intake. Retrieved papers were independently screened, appraised and graded for quality by two researchers. To facilitate comparisons between the interventions, the extracted data were categorised using nine stages along the agentic/structural continuum, from \"downstream\": dietary counselling (for individuals, worksites or communities), through media campaigns, nutrition labelling, voluntary and mandatory reformulation, to the most \"upstream\" regulatory and fiscal interventions, and comprehensive strategies involving multiple components.', 'After screening 2,526 candidate papers, 70 were included in this systematic review (49 empirical studies and 21 modelling studies). Some papers described several interventions. Quality was variable. Multi-component strategies involving both upstream and downstream interventions, generally achieved the biggest reductions in salt consumption across an entire population, most notably 4g/day in Finland and Japan, 3g/day in Turkey and 1.3g/day recently in the UK. Mandatory reformulation alone could achieve a reduction of approximately 1.45g/day (three separate studies), followed by voluntary reformulation (-0.8g/day), school interventions (-0.7g/day), short term dietary advice (-0.6g/day) and nutrition labelling (-0.4g/day), but each with a wide range. Tax and community based counselling could, each typically reduce salt intake by 0.3g/day, whilst even smaller population benefits were derived from health education media campaigns (-0.1g/day). Worksite interventions achieved an increase in intake (+0.5g/day), however, with a very wide range. Long term dietary advice could achieve a -2g/day reduction under optimal research trial conditions; however, smaller reductions might be anticipated in unselected individuals.', 'Comprehensive strategies involving multiple components (reformulation, food labelling and media campaigns) and \"upstream\" population-wide policies such as mandatory reformulation generally appear to achieve larger reductions in population-wide salt consumption than \"downstream\", individually focussed interventions.

Tackling socioeconomic inequalities in health is based on an understanding of how an individual's social position influences disease risk. Conceptually, there are two possible mechanisms (not mutually exclusive): there is either some cause(s) of disease that are unevenly distributed across socioeconomic groups (differential exposure) or the effect of some cause(s) of disease differs across groups (differential effect). Since differential vulnerability and susceptibility are often used to denote the latter, we discuss these concepts and their current use and suggest an epidemiologically relevant distinction.

Exposure of cells to heat shock or other forms of proteotoxic stress induces the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins in the nucleus. We investigated the chromatin landscape of SUMO-2 modifications in response to heat stress. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing, we showed that in response to heat shock, SUMO-2 accumulated at nucleosome-depleted, active DNA regulatory elements, which represented binding sites for large protein complexes and were predominantly associated with active genes. However, SUMO did not act as a direct transcriptional repressor or activator of these genes during heat shock. Instead, integration of our results with published proteomics data on heat shock-induced SUMO-2 substrates supports a model in which the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins acts as an acute stress response that is required for the stability of protein complexes involved in gene expression and posttranscriptional modification of mRNA. We showed that the conjugation of SUMO-2 to chromatin-associated proteins is an integral component of the proteotoxic stress response, and propose that SUMO-2 fulfills its essential role in cell survival by contributing to the maintenance of protein complex homeostasis.

In addition, each dimension of men's embodiment also intersected with the ageing process, a process also shaped in turn by broader social and cultural concerns regarding the positions and possibilities of men's lives as they move through the life course.

While economic incentives have demonstrated success in improving dietary choices, the quantitative impact of different dietary policies on CVD disparities is not well established. We aimed to quantify and compare the potential effects on total CVD mortality and disparities of specific dietary policies to increase fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in the US.', 'Using the US IMPACT Food Policy Model and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, we estimated and compared the reductions in CVD mortality and socio-economic disparities in the US population potentially achievable from 2015 to 2030 with specific dietary policy scenarios: (a) a national mass media campaign (MMC) aimed to increase consumption of F&Vs and reduce consumption of SSBs, (b) a national fiscal policy to tax SSBs to increase prices by 10%, (c) a national fiscal policy to subsidise F&Vs to reduce prices by 10%, and (d) a targeted policy to subsidise F&Vs to reduce prices by 30% among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants only. We also evaluated a combined policy approach, combining all of the above policies. Data sources included the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, National Vital Statistics System, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and published meta-analyses. Among the individual policy scenarios, a national 10% F&V subsidy was projected to be most beneficial, potentially resulting in approximately 150,500 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 141,400-158,500) CVD deaths prevented or postponed (DPPs) by 2030 in the US. This far exceeds the approximately 35,100 (95% UI 31,700-37,500) DPPs potentially attributable to a 30% F&V subsidy targeting SNAP participants, the approximately 25,800 (95% UI 24,300-28,500) DPPs for a 1-y MMC, or the approximately 31,000 (95% UI 26,800-35,300) DPPs for a 10% SSB tax. Neither the MMC nor the individual national economic policies would significantly reduce CVD socio-economic disparities. However, the SNAP-targeted intervention might potentially reduce CVD disparities between SNAP participants and SNAP-ineligible individuals, by approximately 8% (10 DPPs per 100,000 population). The combined policy approach might save more lives than any single policy studied (approximately 230,000 DPPs by 2030) while also significantly reducing disparities, by approximately 6% (7 DPPs per 100,000 population). Limitations include our effect estimates in the model; these estimates use interventional and prospective observational studies (not exclusively randomised controlled trials). They are thus imperfect and should be interpreted as the best available evidence. Another key limitation is that we considered only CVD outcomes; the policies we explored would undoubtedly have additional beneficial effects upon other diseases. Further, we did not model or compare the cost-effectiveness of each proposed policy.', 'Fiscal strategies targeting diet might substantially reduce CVD burdens. A national 10% F&V subsidy would save by far the most lives, while a 30% F&V subsidy targeting SNAP participants would most reduce socio-economic disparities. A combined policy would have the greatest overall impact on both mortality and socio-economic disparities.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Beverages", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cardiovascular Diseases", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Diet", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Food Assistance", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Fruit", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Theoretical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Nutrition Policy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sweetening Agents", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United States", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Vegetables", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pearson-Stuttard J"}, {"clean": "Bandosz P"}, {"clean": "Rehm C"}, {"clean": "Penalvo J"}, {"clean": "Whitsel L"}, {"clean": "Gaziano T"}, {"clean": "Conrad Z"}, {"clean": "Wilde P"}, {"clean": "Micha R"}, {"clean": "Lloyd-Williams F"}, {"clean": "Capewell S"}, {"clean": "Mozaffarian D"}, {"clean": "O'Flaherty M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS Med", "volume": "14", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "BERKMYHL", "DOI": "10.1136/vr.h425", "DOI_filename": "4d5e007dc36731349e2529a679e16035", "PMID": "25634922", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84921859680", "hash": "1344eca2bed55d75451c78ae60208fc0"}, "clean": {"title": "Communication skills training: what the vet schools are doing.", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Clinical Competence", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Communication", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Curriculum", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Education, Veterinary", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Professional-Patient Relations", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Schools, Veterinary", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Mossop L"}, {"clean": "Gray C"}, {"clean": "Blaxter A"}, {"clean": "Gardiner A"}, {"clean": "MacEachern K"}, {"clean": "Watson P"}, {"clean": "Whittlestone K"}, {"clean": "Robb\u00e9 I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Vet Rec", "volume": "176", "issue": "5"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "BH9YBIBN", "DOI": "10.1080/07347332.2018.1440276", "DOI_filename": "c664527516b640adeed843472b3cda91", "PMID": "29611779", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85044723782", "hash": "b645f178b85f6dc9e7930f791b58609c"}, "clean": {"title": "The association of metacognitive beliefs with emotional distress and trauma symptoms in adolescent and young adult survivors of cancer.", "abstract": "['Adolescent and young adults who have survived cancer are at an increased risk of psychological distress.

We aimed to identify an expedited approach to be used as part of the wider COS development process.

We searched MEDLINE from inception to June 2017 to identify studies reporting qualitative empirical findings of perspectives of people with type 2 diabetes. Qualitative methodological filters were used to minimize irrelevant references. Drawing on content analysis, data synthesis involved identifying text in eligible studies relevant to outcomes of type 2 diabetes and interpreting and categorizing this according to the 38 core domains of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials taxonomy. Of 146 studies screened, 26 were included. Four hundred and fifty-eight outcomes were derived from the included studies. In comparison to the outcomes extracted from clinical trials, more life impact outcomes were derived from the qualitative studies, but fewer physiological/clinical outcomes. Outcomes relating to 'mortality/survival' and 'role functioning' were more prevalent in studies conducted in low/middle-income countries. This rapid review and synthesis of qualitative studies identified outcomes that had not previously been identified by a systematic review of clinical trials. It also identified differences in the types of outcomes given prominence to in the clinical trials and qualitative literatures. Incorporating qualitative evidence on patient perspectives from the outset of the COS development process can help to ensure outcomes that matter to patients are not overlooked.

Although a range of ICSs are available, there is little empirical evidence on appropriate behavior change approaches to inform adoption and sustained used at scale. Specifically, evaluations using either quantitative or qualitative methods provide an incomplete picture of the challenges in facilitating ICS adoption. This article examines how studies that use the strengths of both these approaches can offer important insights into behavior change in relation to ICS uptake and scale-up. Epistemological approaches, study design frameworks, methods of data collection, analytical approaches, and issues of validity and reliability in the context of mixed methods ICS research are examined, and the article presents an example study design from an evaluation study in Kenya incorporating a nested approach and a convergent case oriented design. The authors discuss the benefits and methodological challenges of mixed-methods approaches in the context of researching behavior change and ICS use recognizing that such methods represent relatively uncharted territory. The authors propose that more published examples are needed to provide frameworks for other researchers seeking to apply mixed methods in this context and suggest a comprehensive research agenda is required that incorporates integrated mixed-methods approaches, to provide best evidence for future scale-up.

We aimed to map existing public health nutrition policies, and examine their perceived effectiveness, in order to inform future evidence-based diet strategies.', 'We created a public health nutrition policy database for 30 European countries. National nutrition policies were classified and assigned using the marketing \"4 Ps\" approach Product (reformulation, elimination, new healthier products); Price (taxes, subsidies); Promotion (advertising, food labelling, health education) and Place (schools, workplaces, etc.). We interviewed 71 senior policy-makers, public health nutrition policy experts and academics from 14 of the 30 countries, eliciting their views on diverse current and possible nutrition strategies.', \"Product Voluntary reformulation of foods is widespread but has variable and often modest impact. Twelve countries regulate maximum salt content in specific foods. Denmark, Austria, Iceland and Switzerland have effective trans fats bans. Price EU School Fruit Scheme subsidies are almost universal, but with variable implementation.Taxes are uncommon. However, Finland, France, Hungary and Latvia have implemented 'sugar taxes' on sugary foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Finland, Hungary and Portugal also tax salty products. Promotion Dialogue, recommendations, nutrition guidelines, labelling, information and education campaigns are widespread. Restrictions on marketing to children are widespread but mostly voluntary. Place Interventions reducing the availability of unhealthy foods were most commonly found in schools and workplace canteens. Interviewees generally considered mandatory reformulation more effective than voluntary, and regulation and fiscal interventions much more effective than information strategies, but also politically more challenging.\", 'Public health nutrition policies in Europe appear diverse, dynamic, complex and bewildering. The \"4 Ps\" framework potentially offers a structured and comprehensive categorisation. Encouragingly, the majority of European countries are engaged in activities intended to increase consumption of healthy food and decrease the intake of \"junk\" food and sugary drinks. Leading countries include Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Hungary, Portugal and perhaps the UK. However, all countries fall short of optimal activities.

The main barriers identified were the lack of evidence-based guidelines for implementing collective intelligence, complexity in recruiting and engaging the community, and difficulties in disseminating the results of collective intelligence projects. We drew on respondents' experience to provide tips and good practice advice for governance, planning, and conducting collective intelligence projects. Respondents particularly suggested establishing a diverse coordination team to plan and manage collective intelligence projects and setting up common rules of governance for participants in projects. In project planning, respondents provided advice on identifying research problems that could be answered by collective intelligence and identifying communities of participants. They shared tips on preparing the task and interface and organizing communication activities to recruit and engage participants.\", 'Mobilizing collective intelligence through crowdsourcing is an innovative method to increase research efficiency, although there are several barriers to its implementation.

Multivariable linear and quantile regression analyses were conducted to investigate the extent to which family income was associated with child norovirus exposure, and to explore the potential mechanisms through which income might translate into norovirus exposure. Higher norovirus-specific IgG titres were associated with higher family income, but the relationship weakened after controlling for potential mediating factors, mainly increased opportunities for person-to-person contacts, such as formal childcare arrangements.

Regression models were used to assess the associations between a range of cognitive tests measured at different points in the life course, with sedentary behavior in older age recorded over 7 days. Prior simple reaction time (RT) was significantly related to later sedentary time in the youngest, Twenty-07 1950s cohort (p = .04). The relationship was nonsignificant after controlling for long-standing illness or employment status, or after correcting for multiple comparisons in the initial model. None of the cognitive measures were related to sedentary behavior in either of the 2 older cohorts (LBC1936, Twenty-07 1930s). There was no association between any of the cognitive tests and the number of sit-to-stand transitions in any of the 3 cohorts.

Each of the clean fuels reviewed in this study, as well as the supply of electricity, presents both constraints and opportunities for enhanced production, supply, delivery, and long-term sustainability and scalability in resource-poor settings. These options are reviewed and discussed together with policy and regulatory considerations to help in making these fuel and energy choices available and affordable.

They do this by studying the effects that treatments have on patients by measuring outcomes, such as pain and quality of life. Often research teams measure different outcomes even though each team is studying the same condition. This makes it hard to compare the findings from different studies and it can reduce the accuracy of the treatment advice available to patients. Increasingly, researchers are tackling this problem by developing 'core outcome sets'. These are lists of outcomes that all researchers working on a given condition should measure in their studies. It is important that patients have a voice in the development of core outcome sets and children and young people are no exception. But their voices have rarely been heard when core outcome sets are developed. Researchers are trying to address this problem and make sure that core outcome sets are developed in ways that are suitable for children and young people. As a first step, we held two international workshops with children and young people to listen to their views. They emphasised the importance of motivating young people to participate in developing core outcome sets, making them feel valued, and making the development process more interactive, enjoyable and convenient. We hope this commentary will encourage researchers to include children and young people when developing core outcome sets and to adapt their methods so these are suitable for young participants. Future research is important to examine whether these adaptations are effective.\", \"&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; Different research teams looking at treatments for the same condition often select and measure inconsistent treatment outcomes. This makes it difficult to synthesise the results of different studies, leads to selective outcome reporting and impairs the quality of evidence about treatments. 'Core outcome sets' (COS) can help to address these problems. A COS is an agreed, minimum list of outcomes that researchers are encouraged to consistently measure and report in their studies. Including children and young people (CYP) as participants in the development of COS for paediatric conditions ensures that clinically meaningful outcomes are measured and reported. However, few published COS have included CYP as participants. COS developers have described difficulties in recruiting and retaining CYP and there is a lack of guidance on optimising COS methods for them. We aimed to explore CYP's views on the methods used to develop COS and identify ways to optimise these methods.&lt;b&gt;Main body&lt;/b&gt; This commentary summarises discussions during two workshops with approximately 70 CYP (aged 10-18\\u2009years old) at the International Children's Advisory Network Research and Advocacy Summit, 2018. Delegates described what might motivate them to participate in a COS study, including feeling valued, understanding the need for COS and the importance of input from CYP in their development, and financial and other incentives (e.g. certificates of participation). For Delphi surveys, delegates suggested that lists of outcomes should be as brief as possible, and that scoring and feedback methods should be simplified. For consensus meetings, delegates advised preparing CYP in advance, supporting them during meetings (e.g. via mentors) and favoured arrangements whereby CYP could meet separately from parents and other stakeholders. Overall, they wanted COS methods that were convenient, enjoyable and engaging.&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; This commentary points to the limitations of the methods currently used to develop COS with CYP. It also points to ways to motivate CYP to participate in COS studies and to enhancements of methods to make participation more engaging for CYP. Pending much needed research on COS methods for CYP, the perspectives offered in the workshops should help teams developing COS in paediatrics and child health.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sherratt F"}, {"clean": "Bagley H"}, {"clean": "Stones S"}, {"clean": "Preston J"}, {"clean": "Hall N"}, {"clean": "Gorst S"}, {"clean": "Young B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Res Involv Engagem", "volume": "6", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "E8BS6TH7", "DOI": "10.1111/evj.13360", "DOI_filename": "ea4d887a27316cd7bc30ca902f69e2de", "PMID": "33002214", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85094666301", "hash": "be874efe9705552bbe7d63a477a34bef"}, "clean": {"title": "Exploring horse owners' understanding of obese body condition and weight management in UK leisure horses.", "abstract": "[\"Equine obesity is considered one of the most serious welfare concerns in UK leisure horses, yet little is known about how horse owners conceptualise their horse's weight as part of its health, or how they plan and carry out weight management.\", \"This study aimed to further our understanding of leisure horse owners' perceptions of equine health and awareness of excess fat in order to clarify our understanding of successful strategies for managing equine weight.\", 'This study used a qualitative research methodology.', 'Data comprised 16 threads from online UK equine discussion fora, 28 individual interviews with leisure horse owners, 19 interviews with equine professionals such as vets and nutritionists, and two focus groups with a further 21 horse owners.

To address the problems of energy security, deforestation and pollution the government has developed a strategy (Masterplan) to increase use of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 12% to 58% by 2030. As a clean fuel scaled adoption of LPG has the potential to make significant positive impacts on population health. The LPG Adoption in Cameroon Evaluation (LACE) studies are assessing in the community (i) barriers and enablers for and (ii) local interventions to support, adoption and sustained use of LPG. A census survey conducted for LACE in rural and peri-urban regions of SW Cameroon provided an opportunity to investigate current fuel use patterns and factors associated with primary and exclusive use of LPG. A cross-sectional survey of 1577 households (1334 peri-urban and 243 rural) was conducted in March 2016 using standardised fuel use and household socio-demographic questions, administered by trained fieldworkers. Wood (40.7%) and LPG (51.1%) were the most frequently reported fuels, although the dominant fuels in rural and peri-urban communities were wood (81%) and LPG (58%) respectively. Fuel stacking was observed for the majority of LPG using households (91% of peri-urban and 99% of rural households). In rural homes, a higher level of education, access to sanitation and piped water and household wealth (income and asset ownership) were all significantly associated with LPG use (p\\xa0&lt;\\xa00.05). In peri-urban homes, younger age, access to sanitation and piped water and increasing education were significantly associated with both any and exclusive use of LPG (p\\xa0&lt;\\xa00.05). However, whilst household wealth was related to any LPG use, there was no relationship with exclusive use. Results from this census survey of a relatively well-established LPG market with lower levels of poverty and high levels of education than Cameroon as a whole, find LPG usage well below target levels set by the Cameroon government (58% by 2030). Fuel stacking is an issue for the majority of LPG using households. Whilst, as observed here, education, household wealth and socio-economic status are well recognised predictors of adoption and sustained use of clean modern fuels, it is important to consider factors across the whole LPG eco-system when developing policies to support their scaled expansion. A comprehensive approach is therefore required to ensure implementation of the Cameroon LPG Masterplan achieves its aspirational adoption target within its stated timeframe.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cameroon", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cooking", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Cross-Sectional Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Petroleum", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Poverty", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Rural Population", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Suburban Population", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pope D"}, {"clean": "Bruce N"}, {"clean": "Higgerson J"}, {"clean": "Hyseni L"}, {"clean": "Ronzi S"}, {"clean": "Stanistreet D"}, {"clean": "MBatchou B"}, {"clean": "Puzzolo E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Ecohealth", "volume": "15", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "EWIKWJPS", "DOI": "10.1017/S0033291714002633", "DOI_filename": "14d180cdac576f019c60dda1de6c1a57", "PMID": "25388512", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84925799388", "hash": "eb87d624643118c5026134c4421fad91"}, "clean": {"title": "Insecure attachment is associated with paranoia but not hallucinations in psychotic patients: the mediating role of negative self-esteem.", "abstract": "['A growing body of research has investigated associations between insecure attachment styles and psychosis.

We illustrate the use of MSMs in the CPM framework through simulation studies that represent randomized controlled trials and real-world observational data and the example of statin initiation for cardiovascular disease prevention. The simulations include a binary treatment and a covariate, each recorded at two timepoints and having a prognostic effect on a binary outcome. The bias in predicted risk was examined in a model ignoring treatment, a model fitted on treatment-na\u00efve patients (at baseline), a model including baseline treatment, and the MSM. In all simulation scenarios, all models except the MSM underestimated the risk of outcome given absence of treatment. These results were supported in the statin initiation example, which showed that ignoring statin initiation postbaseline resulted in models that significantly underestimated the risk of a cardiovascular disease event occurring within 10 years. Consequently, CPMs that do not acknowledge treatment drop-in can lead to underallocation of treatment. In conclusion, when developing CPMs to predict treatment-na\u00efve risk, researchers should consider using MSMs to adjust for treatment drop-in, and also seek to exploit the ability of MSMs to allow estimation of individual treatment effects.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Cardiovascular Diseases", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Decision Support Techniques", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Prognosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sperrin M"}, {"clean": "Martin G"}, {"clean": "Pate A"}, {"clean": "Van Staa T"}, {"clean": "Peek N"}, {"clean": "Buchan I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "37", "issue": "28"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "F6747DVK", "DOI": "10.1922/CDH_4664Neville08", "DOI_filename": "6897d83b672f6af2e4b16bb9b25ea24f", "PMID": "32031341", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85080866587", "hash": "cefca62b9d95fe7c0d3173c84eca697a"}, "clean": {"title": "Dentistry, e-health and digitalisation: A critical narrative review of the dental literature on digital technologies with insights from health and technology studies.", "abstract": "['To overview current developments in e-health and digitalisation in dentistry and identify gaps in the dental literature on this topic; Basic research design: a critical narrative review of published articles and relevant online materials; Results: Four themes are identified as characterising the current dental literature on e-health and digitalisation: 1) the impact of digitalisation on dental surgeries, 2) digital technology and practice management, 3) digitalisation beyond the dental surgery and in dentist-patient communication, and 4) digital technology and education.

A potentially na\u00efve approach to multi-outcome risk prediction is to derive a CPM for each outcome separately, then multiply the predicted risks. This approach is only valid if the outcomes are conditionally independent given the covariates, and it fails to exploit the potential relationships between the outcomes. This paper outlines several approaches that could be used to develop CPMs for multiple binary outcomes. We consider four methods, ranging in complexity and conditional independence assumptions: namely, probabilistic classifier chain, multinomial logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, and a Bayesian probit model. These are compared with methods that rely on conditional independence: separate univariate CPMs and stacked regression. Employing a simulation study and real-world example, we illustrate that CPMs for joint risk prediction of multiple outcomes should only be derived using methods that model the residual correlation between outcomes. In such a situation, our results suggest that probabilistic classification chains, multinomial logistic regression or the Bayesian probit model are all appropriate choices. We call into question the development of CPMs for each outcome in isolation when multiple correlated or structurally related outcomes are of interest and recommend more multivariate approaches to risk prediction.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Martin G"}, {"clean": "Sperrin M"}, {"clean": "Snell K"}, {"clean": "Buchan I"}, {"clean": "Riley R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "40", "issue": "2"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "FFYVBI2D", "DOI": "10.1186/s12939-017-0524-z", "DOI_filename": "6641489d61b67f503e35b1b04ade9996", "PMID": "28129771", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85010992319", "hash": "0a00b81c38084cd34428fe698bfba5e2"}, "clean": {"title": "Equity aspects of the Primary Health Care Choice Reform in Sweden - a scoping review.", "abstract": "['Good health and equal health care are the cornerstones of the Swedish Health and Medical Service Act.

The reform has had a negative impact on the provision of services for persons with complex needs. Opinions of doctors and staff in PHC are mixed, many state that persons with lesser needs are prioritized. Patient satisfaction is largely unchanged.

Conversely, in large IPD samples, development of a new model and the hybrid method gave the highest performance.

This is reflected in new national contracts for National Health Service (NHS) dentistry that emphasise informing patients on their oral health risk status to persuade them to be accountable for their health. Thus, 'risk' is now central to the practice of dentistry, particularly primary care delivery. An ethnographic study in dental practices in England looked at how risk is acted on in dental settings. 368 dental appointments were observed in five dental practices over a year. The analysis shows three interrelating forms of risk work.

This qualitative study demonstrates that the everyday nature of risk work in NHS dental practices is often implicit, defensive and focused on social interaction rather than the explicit discussions of individual lifestyle risks that policymakers assume.

Despite interdisciplinarity being seen as a virtue, for having the capacity to solve complex problems and foster innovation, it has the potential to place projects and people in anomalous categories. For example, valorised 'outputs' in academia are often defined and rewarded by discipline. Bioinformatics, as an interdisciplinary bricolage, incorporates experts from various disciplinary cultures with their own distinct ways of working. Perceived problems of interdisciplinarity include difficulties of making explicit knowledge that is practical, theoretical, or cognitive. But successful interdisciplinary research also depends on an understanding of disciplinary cultures and value systems, often only tacitly understood by members of the communities in question. In bioinformatics, the 'parent' disciplines have different value systems; for example, what is considered worthwhile research by computer scientists can be thought of as trivial by biologists, and &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;.

These methods, however, are an unreliable proxy for calculating child built-environment exposures as child route choice is more complex than shortest network routes.', 'We hypothesised that a GIS model informed by characteristics of the built-environment known to influence child route choice could be developed to more accurately model exposures. Using GPS-derived walking commutes to and from school we used logistic regression models to highlight built-environment features important in child route choice (e.g. road type, traffic light count).

Here, we describe the development of DIYBOT (Digital Proxy of a Bio-Reactor), which enables remote monitoring of bioreactors and uses the data to inform decisions related to systems management. To test DIYBOT, a household-scale membrane aerated bioreactor with real-time water quality sensors was used to treat household greywater simulant. After reaching steady-state, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) representative of the mixture found in laundry wastewater were injected into the system to represent a chemical contamination. Measurements of carbon metabolism, effluent water quality, biofilm sloughing rate, and microbial diversity were characterized after nanoparticle exposure. Real-time sensor data were analyzed to reconstruct phase-space dynamics and extrapolate a phenomenological digital proxy to evaluate system performance. The management implication of the stable-focus dynamics, reconstructed from observed data, is that the bioreactor self-corrects in response to contamination spikes at AgNP levels below 2.0\\u2009mg/L.

However, little is currently known about the everyday experiences and processes involved in the diagnosis and care of HSV encephalitis. The reported study aimed to provide an account of the diagnosis and treatment of HSV encephalitis from the perspective of people who had been affected by the condition. Thirty narrative interviews were conducted with people who had been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis and their significant others. The narrative accounts reveal problems with gaining access to a diagnosis of encephalitis and shortfalls in care for the condition once in hospital. In response, individuals and their families work hard to obtain medical recognition for the problem and shape the processes of acute care. As a consequence, we argue that the diagnosis and management of HSV encephalitis needs to be considered as a participatory process, which is co-produced by health professionals, patients, and their families.

Script theory proposes that alcohol-related aggression 'scripts' for social behaviors are culturally-available and learned by individuals. The purpose of the study was to understand the content and origins of alcohol-related aggression scripts learned by adolescents. This qualitative focus group study of 40 adolescents (ages 14-16 years) examined alcohol-related aggression scripts. Participants believed aggression and severe injury to be pervasive when young people drink. Viewed through a biological lens, participants described aggression as an 'instinctive' and 'hard-wired' male trait facilitated by intoxication. As such, alcohol-related aggression was not seen as intended or personally controllable and participants did not see it in moral terms. Females were largely viewed as either bystanders of inter-male aggression or potential victims of male sexual aggression. Participants attributed their views on the frequency and nature of alcohol-related aggression to current affairs and reality television, which they felt portrayed a reality of which they had little experience.

It focuses on one aspect of older people's experiences - respect and social inclusion, in the context of a community-based participatory research. Drawing on selected findings (participants' photographs, associated quotes and researchers' field notes), we provide an assessment of the suitability of photovoice methodology for the intended purpose. Four groups of older people (n=26; aged 60 years or more) from four contrasting geographical areas in Liverpool, UK, were recruited purposively. Participants photographed perceived positive and negative aspects of respect and social inclusion in the city, reflecting on the meanings of the photographs in individual (n=23) and group interviews (n=9). Thematic and content analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. The work reported here provides insights into how participants engage with the photovoice process; factors preventing taking photos of interest; and how photographs complement interviews and focus groups. The findings demonstrate that photovoice both facilitated the dissemination of personalised relevant knowledge, and encouraged critical dialogue between participants, and city stakeholders. Reported difficulties included photography of negative and social concepts, and anxiety when taking photographs due to (i) expectations of what is a 'proper' photograph, and (ii) the need to obtain consent from subjects. With preparation, training, and discussion of participants' ideas not expressed through photographs, photovoice was well-suited to this topic, providing insights complementing other research methods.

We estimated reductions in expected CHD deaths in 2030 attributable to these two specific reductions. Output measures were deaths prevented or postponed, life years gained and hospital admissions. A 1% reduction in TFA intake energy intake would generate approximately 3,900 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3,300-4,500) fewer deaths, 10,000 (8,800-10,300) (7% total) fewer hospital admissions and 37,000 (30,100-44,700) life years gained. This would also reduce health inequalities, preventing five times as many deaths and gaining six times as many life years in the most deprived quintile compared with the most affluent. A more modest reduction (0.5%) would still yield substantial health gains.', 'Reducing intake of industrial TFA could substantially decrease CHD mortality and hospital admissions, and gain tens of thousands of life years. Crucially, this policy could also reduce health inequalities. UK strategies should therefore aim to minimise industrial TFA intake.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Coronary Artery Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Dietary Fats", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Theoretical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sex Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Trans Fatty Acids", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pearson-Stuttard J"}, {"clean": "Critchley J"}, {"clean": "Capewell S"}, {"clean": "O'Flaherty M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS One", "volume": "10", "issue": "8"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "JSFMH2FW", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60497-9", "DOI_filename": "4df2f177cf02ec1089a359855085b1f5", "PMID": "32122215", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84904972811", "hash": "768150e41599fbee0e2716fcf772bec4"}, "clean": {"title": "Global, Regional, and National Levels and Trends in Burden of Oral Conditions from 1990 to 2017: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 Study.", "abstract": "[\"Government and nongovernmental organizations need national and global estimates on the descriptive epidemiology of common oral conditions for policy planning and evaluation.

Modelling study using a sector-specific distributional cost effectiveness analysis.", "abstract": "[\"Distributional cost effectiveness analysis is a new method that can help to redesign prevention programmes by explicitly modelling the distribution of health opportunity costs as well as the distribution of health benefits. Previously we modelled cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening audit data from Liverpool, UK to see if the city could redesign its cardiovascular screening programme to enhance its cost effectiveness and equity. Building on this previous analysis, we explicitly examined the distribution of health opportunity costs and we looked at new redesign options co-designed with stakeholders. We simulated four plausible scenarios: a) no CVD screening, b) 'current' basic universal CVD screening as currently implemented, c) enhanced universal CVD screening with 'increased' population-wide delivery, and d) 'universal plus targeted' with top-up delivery to the most deprived fifth. We also compared assumptions around whether displaced health spend would come from programmes that might benefit the poor more and how much health these programmes would generate. The main outcomes were net health benefit and change in the slope index of inequality (SII) in QALYs per 100,000 person years. 'Universal plus targeted' dominated 'increased' and 'current' and also reduced health inequality by -0.65 QALYs per 100,000 person years. Results are highly sensitive to assumptions about opportunity costs and, in particular, whether funding comes from health care or local government budgets. By analysing who loses as well as who gains from expenditure decisions, distributional cost effectiveness analysis can help decision makers to redesign prevention programmes in ways that improve health and reduce health inequality.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Cardiovascular Diseases", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Computer Simulation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Care Costs", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Healthcare Disparities", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "State Medicine", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Collins B"}, {"clean": "Kypridemos C"}, {"clean": "Cookson R"}, {"clean": "Parvulescu P"}, {"clean": "McHale P"}, {"clean": "Guzman-Castillo M"}, {"clean": "Bandosz P"}, {"clean": "Bromley H"}, {"clean": "Capewell S"}, {"clean": "O'Flaherty M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Prev Med", "volume": "130", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "JZJDGM7S", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP1018", "DOI_filename": "c4f47a5c75951d86307ace9515b056d2", "PMID": "28055947", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85008973956", "hash": "0bf39d6882e2b2592d55c686041a9627"}, "clean": {"title": "Implementation Science to Accelerate Clean Cooking for Public Health.", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Air Pollution, Indoor", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cooking", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Environmental Exposure", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Environmental Monitoring", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Public Health", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Rosenthal J"}, {"clean": "Balakrishnan K"}, {"clean": "Bruce N"}, {"clean": "Chambers D"}, {"clean": "Graham J"}, {"clean": "Jack D"}, {"clean": "Kline L"}, {"clean": "Masera O"}, {"clean": "Mehta S"}, {"clean": "Mercado I"}, {"clean": "Neta G"}, {"clean": "Pattanayak S"}, {"clean": "Puzzolo E"}, {"clean": "Petach H"}, {"clean": "Punturieri A"}, {"clean": "Rubinstein A"}, {"clean": "Sage M"}, {"clean": "Sturke R"}, {"clean": "Shankar A"}, {"clean": "Sherr K"}, {"clean": "Smith K"}, {"clean": "Yadama G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Environ Health Perspect", "volume": "125", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "JZV8TVQA", "DOI": "10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203600", "DOI_filename": "b529c855e4a42afa8e6bd9e037d03ca3", "PMID": "24253831", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84895925189", "hash": "63e31a329c3e9a284b0e7b2050758c8f"}, "clean": {"title": "Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone.", "abstract": "['Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting \u03b22 agonist (LABA) is recommended for patients with asthma symptomatic on ICS alone.

In this update of the 2015 edition we included six new trials, additional data from included trials, and addressed comments and criticisms.', 'To summarize the effects of public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs on child growth, haemoglobin, cognition, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality.', 'We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); reference lists; and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 19 September 2018.', 'We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared deworming drugs for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, height, haemoglobin, and formal tests of cognition. We also sought data on other measures of growth, school attendance, school performance, physical fitness, and mortality.', 'At least two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We stratified the analysis based on the background burden of STH infection. We used outcomes at time of longest follow-up. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.', 'We identified 51 trials, including 10 cluster-RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 50 trials included a total of 84,336 participants. Twenty-four trials were in populations categorized as high burden, including nine trials in children selected because they were helminth-stool positive; 18 with intermediate burden; and nine as low burden.First or single dose of deworming drugsFourteen trials reported on weight after a single dose of deworming drugs (4970 participants, 14 RCTs). The effects were variable. There was little or no effect in studies conducted in low and intermediate worm burden groups. In the high-burden group, there was little or no effect in most studies, except for a large effect detected from one study area in Kenya reported in two trials carried out over 30 years ago. These trials result in qualitative heterogeneity and uncertainty in the meta-analysis across all studies (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic = 90%), with GRADE assessment assessed as very low-certainty, which means we do not know if a first dose or single dose of deworming impacts on weight.For height, most studies showed little or no effect after a single dose, with one of the two trials in Kenya from 30 years ago showing a large average difference (2621 participants, 10 trials, low-certainty evidence). Single dose probably had no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI 0.03 lower to 0.22 higher; 1252 participants, five trials, moderate-certainty evidence), or on average cognition (1596 participants, five trials, low-certainty evidence). The data are insufficient to know if there is an effect on school attendance and performance (304 participants, one trial, low-certainty evidence), or on physical fitness (280 participants, three trials, very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported on mortality.Multiple doses of deworming drugsThe effect of regularly treating children with deworming drugs given every three to six months on weight was reported in 18 trials, with follow-up times of between six months and three years; there was little or no effect on average weight in all but two trials, irrespective of worm prevalence-intensity. The two trials with large average weight gain included one in the high burden area in Kenya carried out over 30 years ago, and one study from India in a low prevalence area where subsequent studies in the same area did not show an effect. This heterogeneity causes uncertainty in any meta-analysis (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 78%). Post-hoc analysis excluding trials published prior to 2000 gave an estimate of average difference in weight gain of 0.02 kg (95%CI from 0.04 kg loss to 0.08 gain, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Thus we conclude that we do not know if repeated doses of deworming drugs impact on average weight, with a fewer older studies showing large gains, and studies since 2000 showing little or no average gain.Regular treatment probably had little or no effect on the following parameters: average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.09 lower to 0.13 cm higher; 13,700 participants, 13 trials, moderate-certainty evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.05 g/dL lower to 0.07 g/dL higher; 5498 participants, nine trials, moderate-certainty evidence); formal tests of cognition (35,394 participants, 8 trials, moderate-certainty evidence); school performance (34,967 participants, four trials, moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence assessing an effect on school attendance is inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 5% lower to 8% higher; 20,650 participants, three trials, very low-certainty evidence). No trials reported on physical fitness. No effect was shown on mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low-certainty evidence).', 'Public health programmes to regularly treat all children with deworming drugs do not appear to improve height, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or mortality. We do not know if there is an effect on school attendance, since the evidence is inconsistent and at risk of bias, and there is insufficient data on physical fitness. Studies conducted in two settings over 20 years ago showed large effects on weight gain, but this is not a finding in more recent, larger studies. We would caution against selecting only the evidence from these older studies as a rationale for contemporary mass treatment programmes as this ignores the recent studies that have not shown benefit.The conclusions of the 2015 edition have not changed in this update.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Anthelmintics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Weight", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child Development", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cognition", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Endemic Diseases", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Helminthiasis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Nutritional Status", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Public Health", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Soil", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Weight Gain", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Taylor-Robinson D"}, {"clean": "Maayan N"}, {"clean": "Donegan S"}, {"clean": "Chaplin M"}, {"clean": "Garner P"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev", "volume": "9", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "KBSLC766", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116769", "DOI_filename": "349faf9056bea302d4c86908e6edba92", "PMID": "33225530", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85096693803", "hash": "b8b066ae90e1119ab164a098ec3ffc4f"}, "clean": {"title": "Re: The outcome of pregnancy in women with cystic fibrosis: a UK population-based descriptive study.", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Cystic Fibrosis", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pregnancy Complications", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Pregnancy Outcome", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Duckers J"}, {"clean": "Schlueter D"}, {"clean": "Phillips R"}, {"clean": "Cosgriff R"}, {"clean": "Esan O"}, {"clean": "Paranjothy S"}, {"clean": "Williams D"}, {"clean": "Norman R"}, {"clean": "Taylor Robinson D"}, {"clean": "Carr S"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BJOG", "volume": "128", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "KBUQCK3D", "DOI": "10.1161/JAHA.117.007229", "DOI_filename": "9cbe33986f999a07819376d56ad77ab5", "PMID": "29042426", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85032191012", "hash": "16d5e69b7e7089ace9fa82e8dde6d7ae"}, "clean": {"title": "Relative Survival After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: How Do Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Fare Relative to the General Population?", "abstract": "['Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is indicated for patients with aortic stenosis who are intermediate-high surgical risk.

One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 44 trials included a total of 67,672 participants.

Treating children known to be infectedTreating children known to be infected with a single dose of deworming drugs (selected by screening, or living in areas where all children are infected) may increase weight gain over the next one to six months (627 participants, five trials, low quality evidence). The effect size varied across trials from an additional 0.2 kg gain to 1.3 kg.

Community deworming programmesTreating all children living in endemic areas with a dose of deworming drugs probably has little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.04 kg less, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.04 kg more; trials 2719 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence), even in settings with high prevalence of infection (290 participants, two trials). A single dose also probably has no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.06 g/dL, 95% CI -0.05 lower to 0.17 higher; 1005 participants, three trials, moderate quality evidence), or average cognition (1361 participants, two trials, low quality evidence).Similiarly, regularly treating all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, given every three to six months, may have little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.08 kg, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.27 kg more; 38,392 participants, 10 trials, low quality evidence). The effects were variable across trials; one trial from a low prevalence setting carried out in 1995 found an increase in weight, but nine trials carried out since then found no effect, including five from moderate and high prevalence areas.There is also reasonable evidence that regular treatment probably has no effect on average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.14 lower to 0.17 cm higher; 7057 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.02 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.08 g/dL lower to 0.04 g/dL higher; 3595 participants, seven trials, low quality evidence); formal tests of cognition (32,486 participants, five trials, moderate quality evidence); exam performance (32,659 participants, two trials, moderate quality evidence); or mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low quality evidence). There is very limited evidence assessing an effect on school attendance and the findings are inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 4% lower to 8% higher; 20,243 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence).In a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with adequate allocation concealment, there was no evidence of any effect for the main outcomes.', 'Treating children known to have worm infection may have some nutritional benefits for the individual.

Six indicators of neighbourhood social capital (NSC), neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation (SecD) and their association with psychological well-being among young adolescents aged 10-15 from England and Wales were investigated. Using a random sample of 5201 adolescents (7253 observations) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study merged to aggregated local area census measures, we fitted a series of multilevel models. The findings showed that not being worried about crime and friendship networks mitigated the negative effects of deprivation on adolescent's psychological well-being. These findings suggest that some forms of NSC may have a buffering and protective function, with the strongest effects in deprived neighbourhoods.

The effectiveness of this approach is rarely evaluated and the incidence of dog bites is thought to be increasing. Is the traditional approach to dog bite prevention working as well as it should? In this novel, small scale qualitative study, the perceptions of victims regarding their dog bite experience were explored in-depth. The study recruited 8 female participants who had been bitten by a dog in the past 5 years. In-depth, one-to-one interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate that dog bites may not be as easily preventable as previously presumed, and that education about dog body language may not prevent some types of dog bites. The reasons participants were bitten were multifaceted and complex. In some cases, there was no interaction with the dog before the bite so there was no opportunity to assess the situation and modify behavior around the dog accordingly. Identifying who was to blame, and had responsibility for preventing the bite, was straightforward for the participants in hindsight. Those bitten blamed themselves and/or the dog owner, but not the dog. Most participants already felt they had a theoretical knowledge that would allow them to recognize dog aggression before the dog bite, yet participants, especially those who worked regularly with dogs, routinely believed, \"it would not happen to me.\" We also identified an attitude that bites were \"just one of those things,\" which could also be a barrier prevention initiatives. Rather than being special to the human-canine relationship, the attitudes discovered mirror those found in other areas of injury prevention. A new approach to dog-bite prevention may now be required, drawing on other injury prevention strategies including awareness-raising and minimizing the damage caused by a bite when it happens.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Westgarth C"}, {"clean": "Watkins F"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Vet Behav", "volume": "10", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "KS9P6NQI", "DOI": "10.1080/21678421.2018.1508477", "DOI_filename": "b7979d2df5c03cd5101117c6dd6b6bcc", "PMID": "30398087", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85056173315", "hash": "ccdcd27ed4106062c506d50e882861cd"}, "clean": {"title": "Risk factors for social withdrawal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease.", "abstract": "['Greater social withdrawal is related to higher levels of psychological distress and poorer adaptation to a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'To examine whether demographics and functional deficits can be used to assess which patients may be at risk of social withdrawal and whether symptoms including depression and anxiety can provide additional information for identifying individuals at risk.

We suggest that a more appropriate, albeit inexact, analogy may be drawn with paediatric practice which is premised on a similarly tripartite relationship and where decisions must be reached in the best interests of the child. However, acknowledging the legal status of animals as property and how consent to veterinary treatment is predicated on the animal owner's willingness and ability to pay, we propose that the appropriate response is for veterinary professionals generally to accept the client's choice, provided this is informed.

Costs included government costs to administer and monitor the policy, industry reformulation costs, and CVD-related healthcare, productivity, and informal care costs. Between 2017 and 2036, the optimal reformulation scenario achieving the FDA sodium reduction targets could prevent approximately 450,000 CVD cases (95% uncertainty interval: 240,000 to 740,000), gain approximately 2.1 million discounted QALYs (1.7 million to 2.4 million), and produce discounted cost savings (health savings minus policy costs) of approximately $41 billion ($14 billion to $81 billion). In the modest and pessimistic scenarios, health gains would be 1.1 million and 0.7 million QALYS, with savings of $19 billion and $12 billion, respectively. All the scenarios were estimated with more than 80% probability to be cost-effective (incremental cost/QALY &lt; $100,000) by 2021 and to become cost-saving by 2031. Limitations include evaluating only diseases mediated through BP, while decreasing sodium consumption could have beneficial effects upon other health burdens such as gastric cancer.

We examine whether associations between neighbourhood density of formal physical activity (PA) facilities and body mass index (BMI) are modified by the density of neighbourhood green spaces and takeaway stores. We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank cohort and linked UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBUMP) for 345,269 urban-dwelling adults aged 40-69.

We estimated modifier-stratified associations using multivariable, multilevel models to account for a clustered sampling design and potential confounding. Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess statistical interaction. We found that the association between a greater number of local PA facilities and lower BMI was stronger among people with fewer urban green spaces in their neighbourhood than among those with more green spaces (P&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt;\\xa0=\\xa00.021).

These data detailed trends in the major population cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol, diabetes prevalence, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity levels), and also the uptake of all standard CHD treatments. The main data sources were official statistics (National Health Information Centre and Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic) and national representative studies (AUDIT, SLOVAKS, SLOVASeZ, CINDI, EHES, EHIS). The previously validated IMPACT policy model was then used to combine and integrate these data with effect sizes from published meta-analyses quantifying the effectiveness of specific evidence-based treatments, and population-wide changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Results were expressed as deaths prevented or postponed (DPPs) attributable to risk factor changes or treatments. Uncertainties were explored using sensitivity analyses.', 'Between 1993 and 2008 age-adjusted CHD mortality rates in the Slovak Republic (SR) decreased by 23% in men and 26% in women aged 25-74 years. This represented some 1820 fewer CHD deaths in 2008 than expected if mortality rates had not fallen. The IMPACT model explained 91% of this mortality decline. Approximately 50% of the decline was attributable to changes in acute phase and secondary prevention treatments, particularly acute and chronic treatments for heart failure (\u224812%), acute coronary syndrome treatments (\u22489%) and secondary prevention following AMI and revascularisation (\u22488%). Changes in CHD risk factors explained approximately 41% of the total mortality decrease, mainly reflecting reductions in total serum cholesterol. However, other risk factors demonstrated adverse trends and thus generated approximately 740 additional deaths.', 'Our analysis suggests that approximately half the CHD mortality fall recently observed in the SR may be attributable to the increased use of evidence-based treatments. However, the adverse trends observed in all the major cardiovascular risk factors (apart from total cholesterol) are deeply worrying.

While antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) represent the mainstay of treatment, other potential nondrug interventions are gaining in importance. These treatments all have the potential for harming those using them, as well as bringing benefits. This study examined the views and experiences of PWE about a range of treatment options. We used both qualitative and quantitative approaches - a series of depth-narrative interviews, followed by a large-scale survey. Treatment options and healthcare priorities deemed important by at least 10% of interview participants were then addressed as a series of statements in the follow-on survey questionnaire. Quantitative responses supported healthcare priorities identified through the qualitative interviews. The key goal of treatment among study participants was to be able to live 'a normal life'. Important physical, psychological, and life benefits of treatment were identified - most being the direct consequence of improved seizure control. One psychological benefit, reduced worry, was also identified as an important treatment goal. All participants viewed AEDs as appropriate first-line treatment; and since adverse effects of AEDs had implications for individual levels of daily function and wellbeing, their appropriate management was considered important. In contrast, surgery was almost always regarded as the treatment of last resort. Despite lack of research evidence supporting their use, participants were interested in complementary therapies as adjunctive treatment and a means of coping with having epilepsy, with yoga and meditation of particular interest. An important finding was the desire for targeted services to help with memory problems, as was the call to increase availability of psychological/counseling services. Our findings emphasize the importance of providing treatment responsive to the life context of individual patients.

Exposure of cells to heat shock or other forms of proteotoxic stress induces the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins in the nucleus. We investigated the chromatin landscape of SUMO-2 modifications in response to heat stress. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays coupled to high-throughput DNA sequencing and mRNA sequencing, we showed that in response to heat shock, SUMO-2 accumulated at nucleosome-depleted, active DNA regulatory elements, which represented binding sites for large protein complexes and were predominantly associated with active genes. However, SUMO did not act as a direct transcriptional repressor or activator of these genes during heat shock. Instead, integration of our results with published proteomics data on heat shock-induced SUMO-2 substrates supports a model in which the conjugation of SUMO-2 to proteins acts as an acute stress response that is required for the stability of protein complexes involved in gene expression and posttranscriptional modification of mRNA. We showed that the conjugation of SUMO-2 to chromatin-associated proteins is an integral component of the proteotoxic stress response, and propose that SUMO-2 fulfills its essential role in cell survival by contributing to the maintenance of protein complex homeostasis.

Data from published literature were used to model AAA growth and risk of rupture. The cost-effectiveness analysis used data from published literature and from local and national databases.', 'A combination of systematic review methods and clinical registries were used to provide data to populate models and inform the structure of the ARDA. Discrete event simulation (DES) was used to model the patient journey from diagnosis to death and synthesised data were used to estimate patient outcomes and costs for elective repair at alternative aneurysm diameters. Eight patient clinical scenarios (vignettes) were used as exemplars. The DES structure was validated by clinical and statistical experts. The economic evaluation estimated costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the NHS, social care provider and patient perspective over a lifetime horizon. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the data and the value for money of ARDA-based decisions. The ARDA outcome measures include perioperative mortality risk, annual risk of rupture, 1-, 5- and 10-year survival, postoperative long-term survival, median life expectancy and predicted time to current threshold for aneurysm repair. The primary economic measure was the ICER using the QALY as the measure of health benefit.', 'The analysis demonstrated it is feasible to build and run a complex clinical decision aid using DES. The model results support current guidelines for most vignettes but suggest that earlier repair may be effective in younger, fitter patients and ongoing surveillance may be effective in elderly patients with comorbidities.

The economic evaluation suggests that using the ARDA compared with current guidelines could be cost-effective but there is a high level of uncertainty.', 'Lack of high-quality long-term data to populate all sections of the model meant that there is high uncertainty about the long-term clinical and economic consequences of repair.

Dietary salt intake remains much higher than recommended, increasing blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and stomach cancer. Substantial reductions in salt intake are therefore urgently needed. However, the debate continues about the most effective approaches. To inform future prevention programmes, we systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of possible salt reduction interventions. We further compared \"downstream, agentic\" approaches targeting individuals with \"upstream, structural\" policy-based population strategies.', 'We searched six electronic databases (CDSR, CRD, MEDLINE, SCI, SCOPUS and the Campbell Library) using a pre-piloted search strategy focussing on the effectiveness of population interventions to reduce salt intake. Retrieved papers were independently screened, appraised and graded for quality by two researchers. To facilitate comparisons between the interventions, the extracted data were categorised using nine stages along the agentic/structural continuum, from \"downstream\": dietary counselling (for individuals, worksites or communities), through media campaigns, nutrition labelling, voluntary and mandatory reformulation, to the most \"upstream\" regulatory and fiscal interventions, and comprehensive strategies involving multiple components.', 'After screening 2,526 candidate papers, 70 were included in this systematic review (49 empirical studies and 21 modelling studies). Some papers described several interventions. Quality was variable. Multi-component strategies involving both upstream and downstream interventions, generally achieved the biggest reductions in salt consumption across an entire population, most notably 4g/day in Finland and Japan, 3g/day in Turkey and 1.3g/day recently in the UK. Mandatory reformulation alone could achieve a reduction of approximately 1.45g/day (three separate studies), followed by voluntary reformulation (-0.8g/day), school interventions (-0.7g/day), short term dietary advice (-0.6g/day) and nutrition labelling (-0.4g/day), but each with a wide range. Tax and community based counselling could, each typically reduce salt intake by 0.3g/day, whilst even smaller population benefits were derived from health education media campaigns (-0.1g/day). Worksite interventions achieved an increase in intake (+0.5g/day), however, with a very wide range. Long term dietary advice could achieve a -2g/day reduction under optimal research trial conditions; however, smaller reductions might be anticipated in unselected individuals.', 'Comprehensive strategies involving multiple components (reformulation, food labelling and media campaigns) and \"upstream\" population-wide policies such as mandatory reformulation generally appear to achieve larger reductions in population-wide salt consumption than \"downstream\", individually focussed interventions.

Outcomes like quality of life, side-effects and pain are used in trials to measure whether a treatment is effective. Here, we outline how research groups are increasingly coming together to develop 'core outcomes sets' for particular conditions. Core outcome sets are lists of agreed outcomes. Their use will help in identifying which treatments are effective by enabling people to compare the findings of different clinical trials in the same condition. Currently, it is often very difficult to make these comparisons because different studies often measure different outcomes. Delegates attending the workshops included patients, clinicians and researchers. They discussed ways of making core outcome set development more meaningful and accessible for patients, and ensuring that they have a genuine say in the development process. This article summarises these discussions and concludes by identifying three distinctive challenges in securing patient input to core outcome set development: the process and objectives can seem far removed from the immediate concerns of patients, difficulties can arise in securing patient input on an international scale, and difficulties can also arise in bringing multiple stakeholder groups together to achieve consensus. While patient participation, involvement and engagement in core outcome set development can draw on lessons from other research areas, these distinctive challenges point to the need for distinctive solutions to enable meaningful patient input to core outcome set development.\", '&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt; This article describes three workshops that explored how patients can contribute to decisions about what outcomes are measured in clinical trials. People need evidence about what treatments are best for particular health conditions. The strongest evidence comes from systematic reviews comparing outcomes across different studies of treatments for a particular condition. However, it is often difficult to do these comparisons because the different studies-even though they have all investigated the same condition-often measure different outcomes. To tackle this problem, research teams are increasingly coming together to develop core outcome sets (COS) for particular conditions or treatments. The goal is that across the world, all the research teams working on the same condition or treatment will then use the COS in their research.&lt;b&gt;Main body&lt;/b&gt; We report on three interactive workshops that explored how patients and the public can contribute to decision making about what outcomes should be included in a COS. About 100 international delegates, including researchers, clinicians and patients, attended the workshops. The workshops were held in the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada as part of the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative annual meetings. Patients who had some experience as research advisors, collaborators, partners or co-ordinators facilitated the workshops together with a researcher. Notes made during each workshop informed the preparation of this article. Workshop discussion focussed on ways of making core outcome set development more meaningful and accessible for patients. Delegates wanted patients to have a genuine say, alongside other stakeholders, in what outcomes are included in COS. Delegates felt that key to ensuring this is recognising that patient participation in COS development alone is not enough, and that patients will also need to be involved in the design of COS development studies.&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; We conclude by pointing to some distinctive challenges in including patients in COS development. While the COS development community can draw on the lessons learnt from other research areas about patient participation, involvement and engagement, the distinctive challenges that arise in COS development point to the need for some distinctive solutions too.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Young B"}, {"clean": "Bagley H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Res Involv Engagem", "volume": "2", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "MHYTZPDQ", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jacc.2020.11.010", "DOI_filename": "fe6e7e6c7d8c49c642ec9141681b2dd2", "PMID": "33309175", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85098835749", "hash": "e321f1b8136c07a9c3afbd346c5e614c"}, "clean": {"title": "Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990-2019: Update From the GBD 2019 Study.", "abstract": "['Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability.

Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research.\", \"This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and 'omic' data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies.\", 'Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency; interdisciplinarity; and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data; the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Big Data", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Biomedical Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Databases, Genetic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Information Dissemination", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Murtagh M"}, {"clean": "Blell M"}, {"clean": "Butters O"}, {"clean": "Cowley L"}, {"clean": "Dove E"}, {"clean": "Goodman A"}, {"clean": "Griggs R"}, {"clean": "Hall A"}, {"clean": "Hallowell N"}, {"clean": "Kumari M"}, {"clean": "Mangino M"}, {"clean": "Maughan B"}, {"clean": "Mills M"}, {"clean": "Minion J"}, {"clean": "Murphy T"}, {"clean": "Prior G"}, {"clean": "Suderman M"}, {"clean": "Ring S"}, {"clean": "Rogers N"}, {"clean": "Roberts S"}, {"clean": "Van der Straeten C"}, {"clean": "Viney W"}, {"clean": "Wiltshire D"}, {"clean": "Wong A"}, {"clean": "Walker N"}, {"clean": "Burton P"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Hum Genomics", "volume": "12", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "MX7QPESC", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.g160", "DOI_filename": "6a210ec5c27ad23ac47fb6cce4738c4a", "PMID": "24429924", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84892714653", "hash": "51162bbb0b58304f43525c114c61bb80"}, "clean": {"title": "Poor areas lose out most in new NHS budget allocation.", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Budgets", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Care Rationing", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Local Government", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Poverty Areas", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Barr B"}, {"clean": "Taylor-Robinson D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ", "volume": "348", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "MYEDSJ7I", "DOI": "10.1007/s00127-020-01849-1", "DOI_filename": "7f1272421ef0ce726743f468220dcc7f", "PMID": "32140739", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85081537558", "hash": "962cd79456f66bbb46af97dd54002ead"}, "clean": {"title": "Mental health and prolonged exposure to unaffordable housing: a longitudinal analysis.", "abstract": "['When housing is insufficient, or poor quality, or unaffordable there are well established health effects.

Understanding the role of atopic dermatitis in the development of respiratory allergy may ultimately allow us to determine more effective treatment strategies, thus reducing the patient and economic burden associated with these conditions.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Belgrave D"}, {"clean": "Simpson A"}, {"clean": "Buchan I"}, {"clean": "Custovic A"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Curr Dermatol Rep", "volume": "4", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "N7PZHGU9", "DOI": "10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.01.002", "DOI_filename": "58ab4291899fbfd889fc535cf022e1bc", "PMID": "26895477", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84960404886", "hash": "38671964e7851d0f34e204437083b354"}, "clean": {"title": "Does the concept of resilience contribute to understanding good quality of life in the context of epilepsy?", "abstract": "['A significant body of research highlights negative impacts of epilepsy for individual quality of life (QOL). Poor seizure control is frequently associated with reporting of poor QOL and good seizure control with good QOL; however, this is not a universal finding. Evidence suggests that some people enjoy good QOL despite ongoing seizures while others report poor QOL despite good seizure control. Understanding the factors that influence QOL for people with epilepsy and the processes via which such factors exert their influence is central to the development of interventions to support people with epilepsy to experience the best possible QOL. We present findings of a qualitative investigation exploring influences and processes on QOL for people with epilepsy. We describe the clinical, psychological, and social factors contributing to QOL. In particular, we focus on the value of the concept of resilience for understanding quality of life in epilepsy. Based on our analysis, we propose a model of resilience wherein four key component sets of factors interact to determine QOL. This model reflects the fluid nature of resilience that, we suggest, is subject to change based on shifts within the individual components and the interactions between them. The model offers a representation of the complex influences that act and interact to either mitigate or further compound the negative impacts of epilepsy on individual QOL.

We propose that this paradigm arose from cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies, and may reflect a population pattern that may not predominate at the individual level.', 'Data from 9,801 children in two population-based birth cohorts were used to determine individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis and whether the manifestations of these symptoms followed an atopic march pattern. Children were assessed at ages 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 y. We used Bayesian machine learning methods to identify distinct latent classes based on individual profiles of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis. This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time. Using a latent disease profile model, the data were best described by eight latent classes: no disease (51.3%), atopic march (3.1%), persistent eczema and wheeze (2.7%), persistent eczema with later-onset rhinitis (4.7%), persistent wheeze with later-onset rhinitis (5.7%), transient wheeze (7.7%), eczema only (15.3%), and rhinitis only (9.6%).

Among the research community there have been increasing calls to take more seriously qualitative methods as an alternative or complementary approach to intervention evaluation. Ethnography has been identified as being particularly well suited to the purpose of capturing the full messiness that ensues when health interventions are introduced into complex settings (or systems).

Linear mixed-effects modelling was used to assess differences in longitudinal HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; trajectories (glycaemic control) during 12 months post-diagnosis (1288 HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; data-points) based on DKA, adjusting for sex, age, ethnicity, SES (Socioeconomic Status) and treatment type. Females (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) and younger age, 0-6 vs. 13-18 years (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.6) had increased risk for DKA at diagnosis. Moderate or severe DKA was associated with higher HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; at diagnosis (adjusted estimates 8 mmol/mol, 2-14, and 10 mmol/mol, 4-15, respectively, compared to normal DKA). Differences in HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; trajectories by DKA were no longer apparent at six months post-diagnosis. All subjects experienced a steep decrease in HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; during the first three months followed by a gradual increase. While, DKA severity was not associated with glycaemic control at 12 months post-diagnosis, age at diagnosis, ethnicity, gender, and treatment type were significantly associated. For example, Black and mixed ethnicity children had increased risk for poor glycaemic control compared to White children (adjusted RRR 5.4, 95% CI 1.7-17.3 and RRR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-6.0, respectively). DKA severity at diagnosis is associated with higher initial HbA1&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; but not glycaemic control from six months post-diagnosis. Age at diagnosis, ethnicity, gender, and insulin pump are associated with glycaemic control at one year post-diagnosis.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Blood Glucose", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Diabetic Ketoacidosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Ethnic Groups", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Glycemic Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hyperglycemia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Infant, Newborn", "major": "N"}, {"term": "London", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Longitudinal Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Severity of Illness Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Social Class", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Khanolkar A"}, {"clean": "Amin R"}, {"clean": "Taylor-Robinson D"}, {"clean": "Viner R"}, {"clean": "Warner J"}, {"clean": "Gevers E"}, {"clean": "Stephenson T"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "volume": "15", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "NVPQUI6F", "DOI": "10.1136/jech-2013-203673", "DOI_filename": "c84d379f7988074d9eb98ea46e5f4364", "PMID": "24889054", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85027946980", "hash": "768f1b300c9be94ded736a6bd857cd1e"}, "clean": {"title": "Family employment and child socioemotional behaviour: longitudinal findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study.", "abstract": "['Levels of paid employment in two parent and lone parent families have increased in the UK but evidence of its impact on child socioemotional behaviour is limited and inconsistent.', \"We conducted a longitudinal analysis using the first four sweeps of the Millennium Cohort Study (9\\u2005months, 3 years, 5 years and 7\\u2005years) to investigate the influence of family employment trajectories in the early years on socioemotional behaviour at 7\\u2005years, unadjusted and adjusted for covariates.

Our aim is to investigate how flexicurity policies across European countries impact on the employment chances for people with low education and activity limitations.', 'The longitudinal EU-SILC dataset, pooled 2005-2010, was used to calculate labour market outcomes. The sample consisted of 25 countries and 19,881 individuals. The employment transitions of non-employed people with activity limitations was followed from one year to the next, and the outcomes were rates of return-to work (RTW) among those with low education, and relative equality of RTW between those with low and high education (rate ratio, RR). Data on flexicurity policy and labour market factors were accessed from Eurostat and the OECD. As policy data was only available for OECD countries, the sample was reduced to 21 countries. Fuzzy-set QCA (Qualitative Comparative Analysis) was used to examine how different combinations of the components of flexicurity were linked to the two outcomes.', 'Where high rates of RTW were achieved, high employment rates were always present. In five countries (the Nordic countries and the Netherlands) these factors coexisted with high expenditure on active labour market policies and social services in old age. In three others (The Czech Republic, UK and Estonia) they were combined with low employment protection and low benefit expenditure. For equality in RTW, low unemployment rates were combined with either high benefit expenditure, or low employment protection.', 'We found two routes that lead to high RTW: we characterise these as the high road and the low road. Taking the low road (relaxing employment protection and limiting benefits) may be a tempting option for poorly performing countries. However, without measures to stimulate female employment it may not be enough as high overall employment is so important in enabling people with activity limitations to access the labour market. To achieve equality in RTW, it seems that as long as unemployment is low, either flexibility or security is sufficient.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Educational Status", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Employment", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Europe", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Status", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Probability", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Public Policy", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Qualitative Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Return to Work", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Social Welfare", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Unemployment", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Backhans M"}, {"clean": "Mosedale S"}, {"clean": "Bruce D"}, {"clean": "Whitehead M"}, {"clean": "Burstr\u00f6m B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMC Public Health", "volume": "16", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "PCHXIW8G", "DOI": "10.1038/s42256-020-0197-y", "DOI_filename": "3b47371195bd2ec188acb6294797b5ec", "PMID": "31234945", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85068123592", "hash": "eb1bd0e3ddc02cf81872cbe95b351de0"}, "clean": {"title": "Trials need participants but not their feedback?

Alongside this, the role of other groups of policy actors, including civil servants, politicians and medical professionals, are established and the extent to which British health policymakers have had to work within existing cultural, political, legislative and practical constraints when trying to initiate change is demonstrated.

Although the prognosis for people with HSV encephalitis can be improved by prompt treatment with aciclovir, there are often delays involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. In response, National Clinical Guidelines have been produced for the UK which make recommendations for improving the management of suspected viral encephalitis. However, little is currently known about the everyday experiences and processes involved in the diagnosis and care of HSV encephalitis. The reported study aimed to provide an account of the diagnosis and treatment of HSV encephalitis from the perspective of people who had been affected by the condition. Thirty narrative interviews were conducted with people who had been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis and their significant others. The narrative accounts reveal problems with gaining access to a diagnosis of encephalitis and shortfalls in care for the condition once in hospital. In response, individuals and their families work hard to obtain medical recognition for the problem and shape the processes of acute care. As a consequence, we argue that the diagnosis and management of HSV encephalitis needs to be considered as a participatory process, which is co-produced by health professionals, patients, and their families. The paper concludes by making recommendations for developing the current management guidelines by formalising the critical role of patients and their significant others in the identification, and treatment of, HSV encephalitis.

This study explored the relationship between family income and early childhood exposure to norovirus in the United Kingdom using data from the Millennium Cohort Study linked to serological data. Exposure to norovirus was measured by the level of human norovirus-specific antibodies (titres) obtained from oral fluid samples collected from 5962 pre-school age UK children and tested for Norovirus-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG). Multivariable linear and quantile regression analyses were conducted to investigate the extent to which family income was associated with child norovirus exposure, and to explore the potential mechanisms through which income might translate into norovirus exposure. Higher norovirus-specific IgG titres were associated with higher family income, but the relationship weakened after controlling for potential mediating factors, mainly increased opportunities for person-to-person contacts, such as formal childcare arrangements.

While interesting, this is somewhat at odds with research into the social determinants of obesity, in which the focus has shifted away from individuals and behaviours to the types of wider obesogenic environments in which individuals live, which influence and produce these behaviours. This study combines these two strands of research by investigating how the genetic influence on body mass index (BMI), used as a proxy for obesity, changes across different neighbourhood environments measured by levels of deprivation. Genetics are incorporated using a classical twin design with data from Twins UK, a longitudinal study of UK twins running since 1992. A multilevel modelling approach is taken to decompose variation between individuals into genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental components. Neighbourhood deprivation is found to be a statistically significant predictor of BMI after conditioning on individual characteristics, and a heritability of 0.75 is estimated for the entire sample. This heritability estimate is shown, however, to be higher in more deprived neighbourhoods and lower in less deprived ones, and this relationship is statistically significant. While this research cannot say anything directly about the mechanisms behind the relationship, it does highlight how the relative importance of genetic factors can vary across different social environments, and therefore the value of considering both genetic and social determinants of health simultaneously.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Mass Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Gene-Environment Interaction", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Multilevel Analysis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Overweight", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Residence Characteristics", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Social Isolation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Twin Studies as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Owen G"}, {"clean": "Jones K"}, {"clean": "Harris R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Soc Sci Med", "volume": "185", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "Q67ST98R", "DOI": "10.1111/medu.13373", "DOI_filename": "bb202ae0867759fb09756fac867836da", "PMID": "28748669", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85026354147", "hash": "3b52e9aef7421bf63ef4a77680b34023"}, "clean": {"title": "Is clinical communication the one area of clinical oncology that needs no new ideas?", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Communication", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Oncology", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Neoplasms", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Thinking", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Salmon P"}, {"clean": "Young B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Med Educ", "volume": "51", "issue": "12"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "Q6BEQ64U", "DOI": "10.1182/blood-2014-05-572834", "DOI_filename": "2bff9201a820842399cf12c85b4ca62f", "PMID": "25157182", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84908592823", "hash": "dfd533c4780b5fa109f5d0b6577c0f00"}, "clean": {"title": "Impact of risk factors on the timing of first postpartum venous thromboembolism: a population-based cohort study from England.", "abstract": "['Impact on the timing of first postpartum venous thromboembolism (VTE) for women with specific risk factors is of crucial importance when planning the duration of thromboprophylaxis regimen.

Twenty-three of these were analysed according to modified grounded theory.', \"Knowledge of YFS was very low with no thorough knowledge of the programme's purpose or activities. In general, young people were dissatisfied with the current health services in Soweto citing a lack of resources, long waiting times, and poor quality of care heightened by an underlying lack of choice and perceived inequity. When compared to alternative models of service delivery, no particular model was preferred over another.\", 'Greater knowledge of whether and to what extent local clinics in Soweto are implementing YFS standards is needed.

This qualitative focus group study of 40 adolescents (ages 14-16 years) examined alcohol-related aggression scripts. Participants believed aggression and severe injury to be pervasive when young people drink. Viewed through a biological lens, participants described aggression as an 'instinctive' and 'hard-wired' male trait facilitated by intoxication. As such, alcohol-related aggression was not seen as intended or personally controllable and participants did not see it in moral terms. Females were largely viewed as either bystanders of inter-male aggression or potential victims of male sexual aggression. Participants attributed their views on the frequency and nature of alcohol-related aggression to current affairs and reality television, which they felt portrayed a reality of which they had little experience. The origins of the explicitly biological frameworks that participants used seemed to lie in pre-existing beliefs about the nature of gender differences. Perceptions of the pervasiveness of male alcohol-related aggression, and the consequent failure to view alcohol-related aggression in moral terms, could dispose some young people to alcohol-related aggression.

Population based strategies to reduce specific CHD risk factors have an important role to play in reducing overall CHD mortality. Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce CHD events. This paper presents an economic evaluation of population based salt reduction policies in Tunisia, Syria, Palestine and Turkey.', 'Three policies to reduce dietary salt intake were evaluated: a health promotion campaign, labelling of food packaging and mandatory reformulation of salt content in processed food. These were evaluated separately and in combination. Estimates of the effectiveness of salt reduction on blood pressure were based on a literature review. The reduction in mortality was estimated using the IMPACT CHD model specific to that country. Cumulative population health effects were quantified as life years gained (LYG) over a 10 year time frame. The costs of each policy were estimated using evidence from comparable policies and expert opinion including public sector costs and costs to the food industry. Health care costs associated with CHDs were estimated using standardized unit costs. The total cost of implementing each policy was compared against the current baseline (no policy). All costs were calculated using 2010 PPP exchange rates. In all four countries most policies were cost saving compared with the baseline. The combination of all three policies (reducing salt consumption by 30%) resulted in estimated cost savings of $235,000,000 and 6455 LYG in Tunisia; $39,000,000 and 31674 LYG in Syria; $6,000,000 and 2682 LYG in Palestine and $1,3000,000,000 and 378439 LYG in Turkey.', 'Decreasing dietary salt intake will reduce coronary heart disease deaths in the four countries.

We then examined how risk behaviours and poor health outcomes cluster within and across domains.\", '15% men and 20% women were NEET; 36% men and 32% women were workers; and 49% men and 48% women were students. Young people who were NEET were more likely to report smoking and drug use (men) than other young people. There were few differences in sexual health, although NEETs were more likely to report condomless sex, and NEET women, unplanned pregnancy (past year). Risk behaviours clustered more within and across domains for NEET men. Among NEET women, poor health outcomes clustered across mental, physical and sexual health domains.', 'Harmful health behaviours (men) and poor health outcomes (women) clustered more in those who are NEET. This points to a possible syndemic effect of NEET status on general ill health, especially for women. Our paper is novel in highlighting that elevated risk pertains to sexual as well as mental and physical health.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Tanton C"}, {"clean": "McDonagh L"}, {"clean": "Cabecinha M"}, {"clean": "Clifton S"}, {"clean": "Geary R"}, {"clean": "Rait G"}, {"clean": "Saunders J"}, {"clean": "Cassell J"}, {"clean": "Bonell C"}, {"clean": "Mitchell K"}, {"clean": "Mercer C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMC Public Health", "volume": "21", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "RNBL6AB8", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehv113", "DOI_filename": "27fb24dfcf0ef1cb17e5424b898be89b", "PMID": "25896077", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84937592171", "hash": "67181833f615f8492c3c793c6f97a55f"}, "clean": {"title": "Stroke following percutaneous coronary intervention: type-specific incidence, outcomes and determinants seen by the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society 2007-12.", "abstract": "['This study aims to evaluate temporal changes in stroke complications and their association with mortality and MACE outcomes in a national cohort of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in England and Wales.', 'A total of 426 046 patients who underwent PCI in England and Wales between 2007 and 2012 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) database were analysed.

One of the dangers of ready accessibility of health care data and computational tools for data analysis is that the process of data mining can become uncoupled from the scientific process of clinical interpretation, understanding the provenance of the data, and external validation. Although advances in computational methods can be valuable for using unexpected structure in data to generate hypotheses, there remains a need for testing hypotheses and interpreting results with scientific rigor. We argue for combining data- and hypothesis-driven methods in a careful synergy, and the importance of carefully characterized birth and patient cohorts with genetic, phenotypic, biological, and molecular data in this process cannot be overemphasized. The main challenge on the road ahead is to harness bigger health care data in ways that produce meaningful clinical interpretation and to translate this into better diagnoses and properly personalized prevention and treatment plans.

We investigated sex- and age-standardized trends in stroke mortality in Germany for different stroke subtypes from 1998 to 2015 and assessed potential regional variations between the former Eastern and former Western part of Germany. Methods- Mortality and population data from the German Federal Statistical Office were used to calculate sex- and age-standardized mortality rates for hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and total strokes from 1998 to 2015 for all age groups. Joinpoint regression was used to examine trends and its changes. Estimations were stratified for Eastern and Western part of Germany. Results- From 1998 to 2015, age-standardized total stroke mortality decreased by &gt;50% in men (from 78.0 to 34.1 per 100 000) and women (from 62.1 to 28.4 women per 100 000). The decrease was more pronounced for ischemic stroke mortality (rate change: men, -66%; women, -63%) than for hemorrhagic stroke mortality (men, -40%; women, -31%). Total and ischemic stroke mortality declined more in Eastern than in Western part of Germany. From 1998 to 2015, there were no differences in the decline between the regions in hemorrhagic stroke mortality. Total stroke mortality was higher in Eastern compared with Western part of Germany throughout the study period. Differences in subtype- and sex-specific mortality between the regions decreased from 1998 to 2015.

It was premised on the view that processes to determine capacity for consent, appropriately modified to account for individual capabilities and current circumstances, could facilitate meaningful participation in the development of personal health care plans of people previously excluded from contributing. Methods The present descriptive case study research was undertaken in New South Wales, Australia. A seven-step process for determining capacity for consent was developed, and 10 participants aged between 54 and 73 years with lifelong intellectual disability and health comorbidities were involved. A variety of assistive communication tools was used to support individuals to demonstrate their capacity for giving informed consent. Results After being provided with tailored support mechanisms, seven participants were considered to meet all seven components for determining capacity for consent. Three participants were deemed not to have capacity to give consent regardless of the type of support provided. Conclusions Three critical factors for facilitating personal involvement in decision making for individuals with an intellectual disability were identified: (1) defining consent specifically for the target outcome; (2) outlining the criteria needed for consent to be obtained; and (3) using appropriately modified alternative communication mechanisms as necessary. What is known about the topic? Self-determination is one of the fundamental principles of human rights legislation around the world and, as such, it is considered desirable to have personal input by individuals into the development of their own health care plans. However, this is not always considered feasible if the person comes from a group in the community perceived to be vulnerable to exploitation and viewed as lacking capacity to give informed consent. This results in the use of proxy respondents, who may not accurately represent the desires and life aspirations of the individual. What does this paper add? This paper examines the development and implementation of a targeted program to support individuals aging with lifelong intellectual disability to demonstrate their capacity to provide informed consent. Specifically, it outlines how alternative communications methods, tailored to personal needs and capacity, can assist an individual to both understand and then confirm their understanding of consent in order to participate in developing health care plans. What are the implications for practitioners? People with intellectual disability are now living longer and are increasingly at risk of serious health conditions. The development of long-term health management plans has traditionally not included individuals with more complex needs and moderate intellectual disability, but the present study shows that members of this cohort can successfully understand and consent to participate in health care decision making. By proactively supporting this process, community and healthcare settings may be able to directly facilitate contribution from more individuals, therefore better meeting the goal of person-centred support.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aging", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cognition", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Communication", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Decision Making", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Informed Consent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Intellectual Disability", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Interviews as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "New South Wales", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Patient Satisfaction", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Social Support", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Vulnerable Populations", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Wark S"}, {"clean": "MacPhail C"}, {"clean": "McKay K"}, {"clean": "M\u00fceller A"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Aust Health Rev", "volume": "41", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "S3C7TR83", "DOI": "10.1136/thoraxjnl-2018-212254", "DOI_filename": "949b305ad1ca9702dad53749624890e2", "PMID": "30442657", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85056781726", "hash": "3e43dea844e05d53f590de52db335d85"}, "clean": {"title": "Smoking uptake in UK children: analysis of the UK Millennium Cohort Study.", "abstract": "[\"We used data from 11\\u2009577 children in the UK Millennium Cohort Study, collected at approximately 14 years of age (early teens), to assess characteristics associated with smoking, and generated regional estimates of numbers of smokers. 13.8% of UK early teens studied had ever smoked; 1.9% were current smokers.

This approach allowed us to identify groups of children with similar patterns of eczema, wheeze, and rhinitis over time.

Longitudinal data were taken from the British Household Panel Survey. We compared the health effects of higher wages on recipients of the minimum wage with otherwise similar persons who were likely unaffected because (1) their wages were between 100 and 110% of the eligibility threshold or (2) their firms did not increase wages to meet the threshold. We assessed the probability of mental ill health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. We also assessed changes in smoking, blood pressure, as well as hearing ability (control condition). The intervention group, whose wages rose above the minimum wage, experienced lower probability of mental ill health compared with both control group 1 and control group 2. This improvement represents 0.37 of a standard deviation, comparable with the effect of antidepressants (0.39 of a standard deviation) on depressive symptoms.

From 994 included patients, 50.6% were HCV-, 32.9% were HCV+ never treated with DAAs, and 16.5% were HCV+ treated with DAAs either before (n\\xa0=\\xa066) or after LT (n\\xa0=\\xa098). Patients treated with DAAs before LT presented similar cumulative incidence of wait-list tumor progression when compared with those patients who were HCV+ without DAAs (26.2% versus 26.9%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.47) and a similar HCC-related dropout rate (12.1% [95% CI, 0.4%-8.1%] versus 12.9% [95% CI, 3.8%-27.2%]), adjusted for baseline tumor burden, alpha-fetoprotein values, HCC diagnosis after listing, bridging therapies, and by the probability of having received or not received DAAs through propensity score matching (subhazard ratio [SHR], 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6; P\\xa0=\\xa00.95). A lower incidence of posttransplant HCC recurrence among HCV+ patients who were treated with pre- or post-LT DAAs was observed (SHR, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.2%-4.0%). However, this effect was confounded by the time to DAA initiation after LT. In conclusion, in this multicenter cohort, HCV treatment with DAAs did not appear to be associated with an increased wait-list tumor progression and HCC recurrence after LT.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Antiviral Agents", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Liver Neoplasms", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Liver Transplantation", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Retrospective Studies", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Pi\u00f1ero F"}, {"clean": "Boin I"}, {"clean": "Chagas A"}, {"clean": "Qui\u00f1onez E"}, {"clean": "Marciano S"}, {"clean": "Vilatob\u00e1 M"}, {"clean": "Santos L"}, {"clean": "Anders M"}, {"clean": "Hoyos Duque S"}, {"clean": "Soares Lima A"}, {"clean": "Menendez J"}, {"clean": "Padilla M"}, {"clean": "Poniachik J"}, {"clean": "Zapata R"}, {"clean": "Maraschio M"}, {"clean": "Chong Men\u00e9ndez R"}, {"clean": "Mu\u00f1oz L"}, {"clean": "Arufe D"}, {"clean": "Figueroa R"}, {"clean": "Mendizabal M"}, {"clean": "Hurtado Gomez S"}, {"clean": "Stucchi R"}, {"clean": "Maccali C"}, {"clean": "Vergara Sandoval R"}, {"clean": "Bermudez C"}, {"clean": "McCormack L"}, {"clean": "Var\u00f3n A"}, {"clean": "Gadano A"}, {"clean": "Mattera J"}, {"clean": "Rubinstein F"}, {"clean": "Carrilho F"}, {"clean": "Silva M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Liver Transpl", "volume": "26", "issue": "5"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "TGFSBRV3", "DOI": "10.3109/00207454.2013.866951", "DOI_filename": "8b8e339585c45bdd3173d58f6075f4f3", "PMID": "24256446", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84905963170", "hash": "4474026ccc0e0755a9c644b1df237d05"}, "clean": {"title": "The adverse effects profile of levetiracetam in epilepsy: a more detailed look.", "abstract": "['The adverse effects profile of levetiracetam in epilepsy is still being fully described.

We highlight that accruing this debt can make it more difficult to use the data in the future. Additionally, the long-running nature of cohort studies means that interest is accrued on this debt and compounded over time-increasing the impact a debt could have on a study and its stakeholders. Primary causes of data curation debt are discussed across three categories: longevity of hardware, software and data formats; funding; and skills shortages. Based on cross-domain best practice, strategies to reduce the debt and preventive measures are proposed-with importance given to the recognition and transparent reporting of data curation debt.

This Handbook, developed by the COMET Initiative, brings together current thinking and methodological research regarding those issues. We recommend a four-step process to develop a core outcome set. The aim is to update the contents of the Handbook as further research is identified.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Clinical Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Consensus", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Databases, Factual", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Endpoint Determination", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Evidence-Based Medicine", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Guideline Adherence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Research Design", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Stakeholder Participation", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Williamson P"}, {"clean": "Altman D"}, {"clean": "Bagley H"}, {"clean": "Barnes K"}, {"clean": "Blazeby J"}, {"clean": "Brookes S"}, {"clean": "Clarke M"}, {"clean": "Gargon E"}, {"clean": "Gorst S"}, {"clean": "Harman N"}, {"clean": "Kirkham J"}, {"clean": "McNair A"}, {"clean": "Prinsen C"}, {"clean": "Schmitt J"}, {"clean": "Terwee C"}, {"clean": "Young B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Trials", "volume": "18", "issue": "Suppl 3"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "UB3FNW9K", "DOI": "10.1111/apt.15315", "DOI_filename": "8e6f9c010f5f506c36d0cb471099d7c7", "PMID": "31135073", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85068053399", "hash": "f4ed3b9a63e269e8392d05d1ce2d9e1d"}, "clean": {"title": "Nationwide improvement in outcomes of emergency admission for ulcerative colitis in England, 2005-2013.", "abstract": "['The UK IBD Audit Programme reported improved inpatient care processes for ulcerative colitis (UC) between 2005 and 2013.

We characterized national trends in premature cardiometabolic mortality, overall, and by race-sex groups. Methods and Results Using death certificates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, we quantified premature deaths (&lt;65 years of age) from heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus from 1999 to 2018. We calculated age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and years of potential life lost (YPLL) from each cardiometabolic cause occurring at &lt;65 years of age. We used Joinpoint regression to identify an inflection point in overall cardiometabolic AAMR trends. Average annual percent change in AAMRs and YPLL was quantified before and after the identified inflection point. From 1999 to 2018, annual premature deaths from heart disease (117\\xa0880 to 128\\xa0832), cerebrovascular disease (18\\xa0765 to 20\\xa0565), and diabetes mellitus (16\\xa0553 to 24\\xa0758) as an underlying cause of death increased. By 2018, 19.7% of all heart disease deaths, 13.9% of all cerebrovascular disease deaths, and 29.1% of all diabetes mellitus deaths were premature. AAMRs and YPLL from heart disease and cerebrovascular disease declined until the inflection point identified in 2011, then remained unchanged through 2018. Conversely, AAMRs and YPLL from diabetes mellitus did not change through 2011, then increased through 2018. Black men and women had higher AAMRs and greater YPLL for each cardiometabolic cause compared with White men and women, respectively.

Yet, the most intimate insights of suicide are lost by not including the voices of those with lived experience of suicide attempt. Through an online, community-based, non-representative survey exploring the impact of exposure to suicide, a sub-sample of 88 participants responded who reported their exposure to suicide as being their own attempt. The survey covered demographic information, questions assessing exposure to suicide attempts and death, current global psychological distress via the Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) Scale, and short qualitative responses provided by 46 participants. The qualitative data was thematically analysed resulting in three themes; the way in which individuals experienced being suicidal; who they were able, or not, to disclose these intentions to-before and after their suicide attempt; and, how these people experienced the formal and informal health care supports available to them to assist with their suicidal crisis. This paper presents important findings from a sample of participants who are highly distressed, and have previously attempted to take their own lives. This adds depth to our understanding of lived experience of suicide attempt, issues associated with seeking appropriate support after suicide attempt, and also demonstrates a willingness of participants to share their stories, even in a study that did not explicitly target those with lived experience of suicide attempt. The need for consistent and compassionate mental health care after a suicide attempt is identified as a vital component of living well after a suicide attempt.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Australia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Suicidal Ideation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Suicide, Attempted", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Survivors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Maple M"}, {"clean": "McKay K"}, {"clean": "Sanford R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "volume": "16", "issue": "22"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "V2MYEPVW", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101486", "DOI_filename": "7fff682ce4cf5ffc0c15e744f63167a0", "PMID": "33359234", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85098942708", "hash": "db7878d0b4fade557bbc190425353cf2"}, "clean": {"title": "Prospective Latin American cohort evaluating outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and abnormal liver tests on admission.", "abstract": "['The independent effect of liver biochemistries as a prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19 has not been completely addressed.

Quantitative studies reporting participant predictors of recruitment and retention in RCTs involving children aged 0-12 were identified. Data was extracted and synthesised narratively. Quality assessment of articles was conducted using a structured tool developed from two existing quality evaluation checklists.', \"Twenty-eight studies were included in the review. Of the 154 participant factors reported, 66 were found to be significant predictors of recruitment and retention in at least one study. These were classified as parent, child, family and neighbourhood characteristics. Parent characteristics (e.g. ethnicity, age, education, socioeconomic status (SES)) were the most commonly reported predictors of participation for both recruitment and retention. Being young, less educated, of an ethnic minority and having low SES appear to be barriers to participation in RCTs although there was little agreement between studies. When analysed according to setting and severity of the child's illness there appeared to be little variation between groups. The quality of the studies varied. Articles adhered well to reporting guidelines around provision of a scientific rationale for the study and background information as well as displaying good internal consistency of results. However, few studies discussed the external validity of the results or provided recommendations for future research.\", 'Parent characteristics may predict participation of children and their families to RCTs; however, there was a lack of consensus. Whilst sociodemographic variables may be useful in identifying which groups are least likely to participate they do not provide insight into the processes and barriers to participation for children and families. Further studies that explore variables that can be influenced are warranted. Reporting of studies in this field need greater clarity as well as agreed definitions of what is meant by retention.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child Behavior", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Family Characteristics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Behavior", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Odds Ratio", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Parents", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Patient Dropouts", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Patient Selection", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Pediatrics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Research Subjects", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sample Size", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Socioeconomic Factors", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Robinson L"}, {"clean": "Adair P"}, {"clean": "Coffey M"}, {"clean": "Harris R"}, {"clean": "Burnside G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Trials", "volume": "17", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "V9NMIAIC", "DOI": "10.1136/jech-2019-212191", "DOI_filename": "7ca79fa362f48810e160c6a581f51ac9", "PMID": "31036606", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85065439625", "hash": "4d6c920fd8fe830c978772dff589335a"}, "clean": {"title": "Too sick to work, too healthy to qualify: a cross-country analysis of the effect of changes to disability benefits.", "abstract": "['Denmark and Sweden have implemented reforms that narrowed disability benefit eligibility criteria.

We illustrate the use of MSMs in the CPM framework through simulation studies that represent randomized controlled trials and real-world observational data and the example of statin initiation for cardiovascular disease prevention. The simulations include a binary treatment and a covariate, each recorded at two timepoints and having a prognostic effect on a binary outcome. The bias in predicted risk was examined in a model ignoring treatment, a model fitted on treatment-na\u00efve patients (at baseline), a model including baseline treatment, and the MSM. In all simulation scenarios, all models except the MSM underestimated the risk of outcome given absence of treatment. These results were supported in the statin initiation example, which showed that ignoring statin initiation postbaseline resulted in models that significantly underestimated the risk of a cardiovascular disease event occurring within 10 years. Consequently, CPMs that do not acknowledge treatment drop-in can lead to underallocation of treatment. In conclusion, when developing CPMs to predict treatment-na\u00efve risk, researchers should consider using MSMs to adjust for treatment drop-in, and also seek to exploit the ability of MSMs to allow estimation of individual treatment effects.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Cardiovascular Diseases", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Decision Support Techniques", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Prognosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Treatment Outcome", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sperrin M"}, {"clean": "Martin G"}, {"clean": "Pate A"}, {"clean": "Van Staa T"}, {"clean": "Peek N"}, {"clean": "Buchan I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "37", "issue": "28"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "WAFB2YVD", "DOI": "10.1007/s11883-018-0726-x", "DOI_filename": "c22ccb6288230db2eaa14779ec5fc0bf", "PMID": "29654423", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85045692428", "hash": "8c426eb7192e81fb756601c21b55af40"}, "clean": {"title": "Adoption and Design of Emerging Dietary Policies to Improve Cardiometabolic Health in the US.", "abstract": "['Suboptimal diet is a leading cause of cardiometabolic disease and economic burdens.

Recent state proposals included sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes, marketing restrictions, and SNAP restrictions, but few were enacted. Local efforts varied significantly, with certain localities consistently leading in the proposal or adoption of relevant policies. Across all jurisdictions, most commonly selected dietary targets included fruits and vegetables, SSBs, trans-fat, added sugar, sodium, and calories; other healthy (e.g., nuts) or unhealthy (e.g., processed meats) factors were largely not addressed.

Characteristics of certain elements were similarly defined (e.g., fruit and vegetable definition, warning language used in SSB warning labels), while others varied across cases within a policy (e.g., tax base for SSB taxes).

Complex substrate, limited test performance, low outcome incidence, and long test to outcome times inevitably generate low positive and high negative predictive values. When combined with spectrum bias, the generalizability, incremental value, and cost-effectiveness of device algorithms are questionable. To avoid these pitfalls, remote monitoring may need to shift from crisis detection to health maintenance, keeping the patient within an ideal physiological range through continuous 'closed loop' interaction and dynamic therapy adjustment. Test performance must also improve, possibly through combination with physiological sensors in different dimensions, static baseline characteristics, and biomarkers.

This paper reports on the complexity involved in disclosing suicidal thoughts or behavior prior to, at the time, or post attempt; the role that help seeking has when someone is acutely suicidal; and the challenges people have in finding their voice at these critical junctures. These factors are both inter- and intra-personal, and are influenced by stigma and lack of understanding of the suicidal state.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Maple M"}, {"clean": "Frey L"}, {"clean": "McKay K"}, {"clean": "Coker S"}, {"clean": "Grey S"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Arch Suicide Res", "volume": "24", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "XJU2NJB6", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMoa1608033", "DOI_filename": "71ad53862ba467b09d280f8b3bb6ef21", "PMID": "27593504", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84985915438", "hash": "bbc2f9a76d5be4490a5b22d731435d97"}, "clean": {"title": "Effectiveness of Fluticasone Furoate-Vilanterol for COPD in Clinical Practice.", "abstract": "['Evidence for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comes from closely monitored efficacy trials involving groups of patients who were selected on the basis of restricted entry criteria.

Global elimination programs, involving mass drug administration (MDA), have been launched by the World Health Organisation. Although the drugs used are generally well tolerated, individuals who are highly co-infected with Loa loa are at risk of experiencing serious adverse events. Highly infected individuals are more likely to be found in communities with high prevalence. An understanding of the relationship between individual infection and population-level prevalence can therefore inform decisions on whether MDA can be safely administered in an endemic community. Based on Loa loa infection intensity data from individuals in Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo we develop a statistical model for the distribution of infection levels in communities. We then use this model to make predictive inferences regarding the proportion of individuals whose parasite count exceeds policy-relevant levels. In particular we show how to exploit the positive correlation between community-level prevalence and intensity of infection in order to predict the proportion of highly infected individuals in a community given only prevalence data from the community in question. The resulting prediction intervals are not substantially wider, and in some cases narrower, than the corresponding binomial confidence intervals obtained from data that include measurements of individual infection levels. Therefore the model developed here facilitates the estimation of the proportion of individuals highly infected with Loa loa using only estimated community level prevalence. It can be used to assess the risk of rolling out MDA in a specific community, or to guide policy decisions.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Animals", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cameroon", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Congo", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Elephantiasis, Filarial", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Loa", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Loiasis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Onchocerciasis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Residence Characteristics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Rural Population", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Schl\u00fcter D"}, {"clean": "Ndeffo-Mbah M"}, {"clean": "Takougang I"}, {"clean": "Ukety T"}, {"clean": "Wanji S"}, {"clean": "Galvani A"}, {"clean": "Diggle P"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS Negl Trop Dis", "volume": "10", "issue": "12"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "XRUS7WV6", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.i6253", "DOI_filename": "febe3e0feeb0135decfdc9b98732f1ca", "PMID": "27919934", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85006113555", "hash": "2e25bb6f8dd717ab6b3390bfbd7690b3"}, "clean": {"title": "Development and validation of risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in postpartum women: multinational cohort study.", "abstract": "['\\xa0To develop and validate a risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in the first six weeks after delivery (early postpartum).', '\\xa0Cohort study.', '\\xa0Records from England based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and data from Sweden based registry.', '\\xa0All pregnant women registered with CPRD-HES linked data between 1997 and 2014 and Swedish medical birth registry between 2005 and 2011 with postpartum follow-up.', '\\xa0Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction model for postpartum venous thromboembolism based on the English data, which was externally validated in the Swedish data.', '\\xa0433\\u2009353 deliveries were identified in the English cohort and 662\\u2009387 in the Swedish cohort.

A policy analysis of published documents on the NHS dental contract reforms from 2009 to 2016 was conducted to consider how conditionality is justified and whether its execution is likely to cause distributional effects. Contractualist, paternalistic and mutualist arguments that reflect notions of responsibility and obligation are used as justification within policy.

We argue that the proposed conditional component may differentially affect disadvantaged patients, who do not necessarily have access to the resources needed to meet the behavioural requirements.

We summarise integration techniques and go beyond previous publications by highlighting the potential value of integration using three examples that are specific to RCTs. We suggest that applying mixed methods integration techniques to data or findings from studies involving both RCTs and qualitative research can yield insights that might be useful for understanding variation in outcomes, the mechanism by which interventions have an impact, and identifying ways of tailoring therapy to patient preference and type. Given a general lack of examples and knowledge of these techniques, researchers and funders will need future guidance on how to undertake and appraise them.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Qualitative Research", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Richards D"}, {"clean": "Bazeley P"}, {"clean": "Borglin G"}, {"clean": "Craig P"}, {"clean": "Emsley R"}, {"clean": "Frost J"}, {"clean": "Hill J"}, {"clean": "Horwood J"}, {"clean": "Hutchings H"}, {"clean": "Jinks C"}, {"clean": "Montgomery A"}, {"clean": "Moore G"}, {"clean": "Plano Clark V"}, {"clean": "Tonkin-Crine S"}, {"clean": "Wade J"}, {"clean": "Warren F"}, {"clean": "Wyke S"}, {"clean": "Young B"}, {"clean": "O'Cathain A"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ Open", "volume": "9", "issue": "11"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "XUUVSY5Q", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0215392", "DOI_filename": "f5071e081c1bb09f3d3b4b6cabfbc423", "PMID": "30995272", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85064431655", "hash": "fe2b900ecf2973cde86c124e63893aca"}, "clean": {"title": "Adverse risk factor trends limit gains in coronary heart disease mortality in Barbados: 1990-2012.", "abstract": "['Although most countries face increasing population levels of obesity and diabetes their effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality has not been often studied in small island developing states (SIDs) where obesity rates are among the highest in the world.

I argue that sperm donors faced particular challenges to incorporating payment within a gift narrative for two key reasons: first, sperm donors relied on a discourse of 'pure altruism', including absolute opposition between gifts and market exchange, in order to present their donation as other-oriented. In contrast, egg donors were also able to mobilise a discourse of relational giving to present their donations as a personal gift.

However, the cost-effectiveness and equity of population CVD screening is contested. This study aimed to determine whether the NHS Health Check programme is cost-effective and equitable in a city with high levels of deprivation and CVD.', \"IMPACTNCD is a dynamic stochastic microsimulation policy model, calibrated to Liverpool demographics, risk factor exposure, and CVD epidemiology. Using local and national data, as well as drawing on health and social care disease costs and health-state utilities, we modelled 5 scenarios from 2017 to 2040: Scenario (A): continuing current implementation of NHS Health Check;Scenario (B): implementation 'targeted' toward areas in the most deprived quintile with increased coverage and uptake;Scenario (C): 'optimal' implementation assuming optimal coverage, uptake, treatment, and lifestyle change;Scenario (D): scenario A combined with structural population-wide interventions targeting unhealthy diet and smoking;Scenario (E): scenario B combined with the structural interventions as above. We compared all scenarios with a counterfactual of no-NHS Health Check.

Multiple binary logistic regression models were used to examine the association between social factors and health for men and women separately. We further identified the relative contribution of different factors to total gender inequality in health using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method.', 'Whereas time allocated to paid work, housework and active leisure activities were positively associated with health, time devoted to passive leisure and personal activities were negatively associated with health among both men and women, but the magnitude of the association varied by gender and country. We found significant gender differences in health in Germany, Italy and Spain, but not in the other countries. The decomposition showed that differences in the time allocated to active leisure and level of educational attainment accounted for the largest health gap.', 'Our study represents a first step in understanding cross-national differences in the association between health status and time devoted to role-related activities among elderly men and women. The results, therefore, demonstrate the need of using an integrated framework of social factors in analyzing and explaining the gender and cross-national differences in the health of the elderly population.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Family", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Status", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Self Report", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Social Class", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Social Welfare", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Adjei N"}, {"clean": "Brand T"}, {"clean": "Zeeb H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS One", "volume": "12", "issue": "9"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "Z7T8FL3H", "DOI": "10.1017/S1463423618000488", "DOI_filename": "a88f7df4acb5e65f2dccea19ad77f598", "PMID": "30068402", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85059856969", "hash": "d08b0a7c9ff844ea556df360eb42faca"}, "clean": {"title": "Strategies, facilitators and barriers to implementation of evidence-based practice in community nursing: a systematic mixed-studies review and qualitative synthesis.", "abstract": "['AimTo appraise and synthesize empirical literature on implementation of evidence within community nursing.

Learning lessons from the features of the English health research system calls for an understanding of the processes which shaped it. Firstly, the publicly funded, nationally organised character of healthcare promoted government interest in evidence-based medicine, made research prioritisation simpler and helped promote the implementation of findings. Secondly, the essential role of leadership by a group who valued research for its health impact ensured that new management methods (such as metrics and competitive tendering) were harnessed to patient benefit, rather than as an end in themselves. A policy window of government willingness to invest in R&D for wider economic goals and buoyant funding of the health system were also effectively exploited.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Biomedical Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Evidence-Based Practice", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Government Programs", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Health Services Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "History, 21st Century", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Information Dissemination", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Politics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "State Medicine", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Atkinson P"}, {"clean": "Sheard S"}, {"clean": "Walley T"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Health Res Policy Syst", "volume": "17", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ZG7BQJZQ", "DOI": "10.2217/ijr.15.32", "DOI_filename": "6d7eca56814169d92448a3d2eb3b19a3", "PMID": "29675943", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85053043645", "hash": "6c6e4363a31a7ef797b10101b3ef9227"}, "clean": {"title": "Relationship of anxiety with joint pain and its management: A population survey.", "abstract": "['The aims of the present study was to examine the associations between the severity of pain and anxiety in a community population reporting joint pain, and to investigate the management of joint pain in the presence of comorbid anxiety.', 'A population survey was carried out of people aged \u226545\\xa0years, registered with eight general practices in Cheshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, UK.

Potential participants were identified from the database of a large UK-based randomized controlled trial of antiepileptic drug treatment for new-onset epilepsy and selected using purposive sampling methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with 67 people; interview material was analyzed thematically. Our findings confirm 'loss' as a key concept in understanding epilepsy impact. Participants cited profound physical and social losses, and the links between these and psychological loss were clearly articulated. Informants described two main processes via which the linked losses they experienced occurred: personal withdrawal processes and externally enforced processes. Seizure control was integral to restoring psychological well-being and a sense of normality but was only one of a number of influences moderating the degree of loss experienced following seizure onset. Our work emphasizes that people with epilepsy (PWE) require active support for their continued engagement or reengagement in roles and activities identified as central to their psychological well-being and overall QOL. Achieving this requires a multiagency approach to drive forward key strategies for reduction of the negative impacts of epilepsy and to engender a sense of normality in the context of a condition often experienced as placing the individual outside the socially determined parameters of the 'normal'. \"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adaptation, Psychological", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Anticonvulsants", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Chronic Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epilepsy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Qualitative Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Quality of Life", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sickness Impact Profile", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Surveys and Questionnaires", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Jacoby A"}, {"clean": "Ring A"}, {"clean": "Whitehead M"}, {"clean": "Marson A"}, {"clean": "Baker G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Epilepsy Behav", "volume": "33", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ZSWKIZCR", "DOI": "10.1007/s00125-014-3456-9", "DOI_filename": "9dc60c22d5ba5563ff138d948150db51", "PMID": "25481707", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84924662049", "hash": "77cacea88246d661f40ceb9f1cd52e08"}, "clean": {"title": "Pioglitazone and bladder cancer risk: a multipopulation pooled, cumulative exposure analysis.", "abstract": "['The evidence on the association between pioglitazone use and bladder cancer is contradictory, with many studies subject to allocation bias.

This paper formulates the approach to a 'best interests' calculation, utilising the factors included in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and relying on exchange of information between the human parties involved. Although this form of decision-making must primarily protect the animal from unnecessary suffering, it recognises that the information provided by the owner is critical in articulating the animal's non-medical interests, and hence in formulating what is in the animal's best overall welfare interests. While statute law does not mandate consideration of 'best interests' for animals, this approach might reasonably be expected as a professional imperative for veterinary surgeons.

To unravel this evolutionary riddle, several models have been developed within the theoretical framework of spatial game theory, focussing on the interactions between two general classes of player, \"cooperators\" and \"defectors\". Generally, explicit movement in the spatial domain is not considered in these models, with strategies moving via imitation or through colonisation of neighbouring sites. We present here a spatially explicit stochastic individual-based model in which pure cooperators and defectors undergo random motion via diffusion and also chemotaxis guided by the gradient of a semiochemical. Individual movement rules are derived from an underlying system of reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations which describes the dynamics of the local number of individuals and the concentration of the semiochemical. Local interactions are governed by the payoff matrix of the classical prisoner\\'s dilemma, and accumulated payoffs are translated into offspring. We investigate the cases of both synchronous and non-synchronous generations. Focussing on an ecological scenario where defectors are parasitic on cooperators, we find that random motion and semiochemical sensing bring about self-generated patterns in which resident cooperators and parasitic defectors can coexist in proportions that fluctuate about non-zero values. Remarkably, coexistence emerges as a genuine consequence of the natural tendency of cooperators to aggregate into clusters, without the need for them to find physical shelter or outrun the parasitic defectors. This provides further evidence that spatial clustering enhances the benefits of mutual cooperation and plays a crucial role in preserving cooperative behaviours.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Algorithms", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Animals", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Computer Simulation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cooperative Behavior", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Game Theory", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Theoretical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Movement", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Population Density", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Population Dynamics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Prisoner Dilemma", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Stochastic Processes", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Burgess A"}, {"clean": "Lorenzi T"}, {"clean": "Schofield P"}, {"clean": "Hubbard S"}, {"clean": "Chaplain M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Theor Biol", "volume": "419", "issue": ""}}}];</script></div></div><div class="foot"> Stats last updated on 2021-04-29 14:07:57</div></body></html>
