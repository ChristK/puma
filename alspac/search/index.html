New diagnostic categories rely on the distinct clinical utility of irritability, and models of psychopathology suggest it plays a key role in explaining developmental pathways within and between disorders into adulthood. However, only a few studies have tested multidimensional models of ODD, and the results have been conflicting. Further, consensus has not been reached regarding which symptoms best identify irritability. The present analyses use 5 large community data sets with 5 different measures of parent-reported ODD, comprising 16,280 youth in total, to help resolve these questions. Across the samples, ages ranged from 5 to 18, and included both boys and girls. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a modified bifactor model showed the best fit in each data set. The structure of the model included 2 correlated specific factors (irritability and oppositional behavior) in addition to a general ODD factor. In 4 models, the best fit was obtained using the items \"being touchy,\" \"angry,\" and \"often losing temper\" as indicators of irritability. Given the structure of the models and the generally high correlation between the specific dimensions, the results suggest that irritability may not be sufficiently distinct from oppositional behavior to support an entirely independent diagnosis. Rather, irritability may be better understood as a dimension of psychopathology that can be distinguished within ODD, and which may be related to particular forms of psychopathology apart from ODD.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Irritable Mood", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Burke J"}, {"clean": "Boylan K"}, {"clean": "Rowe R"}, {"clean": "Duku E"}, {"clean": "Stepp S"}, {"clean": "Hipwell A"}, {"clean": "Waldman I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Abnorm Psychol", "volume": "123", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "7SNS5E4H", "DOI": "10.1007/s10519-014-9654-x", "DOI_filename": "6090ce8451e5fe8dacfadf384369f56e", "PMID": "24828478", "scopus": "2-s2.0-84903820211", "hash": "f681a396bba93777b74eb58babbd9ed8"}, "clean": {"title": "Harmonization of Neuroticism and Extraversion phenotypes across inventories and cohorts in the Genetics of Personality Consortium: an application of Item Response Theory.", "abstract": "['Mega- or meta-analytic studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies) are increasingly used in behavior genetics. An issue in such studies is that phenotypes are often measured by different instruments across study cohorts, requiring harmonization of measures so that more powerful fixed effect meta-analyses can be employed. Within the Genetics of Personality Consortium, we demonstrate for two clinically relevant personality traits, Neuroticism and Extraversion, how Item-Response Theory (IRT) can be applied to map item data from different inventories to the same underlying constructs. Personality item data were analyzed in &gt;160,000 individuals from 23 cohorts across Europe, USA and Australia in which Neuroticism and Extraversion were assessed by nine different personality inventories. Results showed that harmonization was very successful for most personality inventories and moderately successful for some. Neuroticism and Extraversion inventories were largely measurement invariant across cohorts, in particular when comparing cohorts from countries where the same language is spoken. The IRT-based scores for Neuroticism and Extraversion were heritable (48 and 49 %, respectively, based on a meta-analysis of six twin cohorts, total N = 29,496 and 29,501 twin pairs, respectively) with a significant part of the heritability due to non-additive genetic factors. For Extraversion, these genetic factors qualitatively differ across sexes. We showed that our IRT method can lead to a large increase in sample size and therefore statistical power. The IRT approach may be applied to any mega- or meta-analytic study in which item-based behavioral measures need to be harmonized.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Anxiety Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Extraversion, Psychological", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Neuroticism", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Personality", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Personality Assessment", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Phenotype", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "van den Berg S"}, {"clean": "de Moor M"}, {"clean": "McGue M"}, {"clean": "Pettersson E"}, {"clean": "Terracciano A"}, {"clean": "Verweij K"}, {"clean": "Amin N"}, {"clean": "Derringer J"}, {"clean": "Esko T"}, {"clean": "van Grootheest G"}, {"clean": "Hansell N"}, {"clean": "Huffman J"}, {"clean": "Konte B"}, {"clean": "Lahti J"}, {"clean": "Luciano M"}, {"clean": "Matteson L"}, {"clean": "Viktorin A"}, {"clean": "Wouda J"}, {"clean": "Agrawal A"}, {"clean": "Allik J"}, {"clean": "Bierut L"}, {"clean": "Broms U"}, {"clean": "Campbell H"}, {"clean": "Smith G"}, {"clean": "Eriksson J"}, {"clean": "Ferrucci L"}, {"clean": "Franke B"}, {"clean": "Fox J"}, {"clean": "de Geus E"}, {"clean": "Giegling I"}, {"clean": "Gow A"}, {"clean": "Grucza R"}, {"clean": "Hartmann A"}, {"clean": "Heath A"}, {"clean": "Heikkil\u00e4 K"}, {"clean": "Iacono W"}, {"clean": "Janzing J"}, {"clean": "Jokela M"}, {"clean": "Kiemeney L"}, {"clean": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T"}, {"clean": "Madden P"}, {"clean": "Magnusson P"}, {"clean": "Northstone K"}, {"clean": "Nutile T"}, {"clean": "Ouwens K"}, {"clean": "Palotie A"}, {"clean": "Pattie A"}, {"clean": "Pesonen A"}, {"clean": "Polasek O"}, {"clean": "Pulkkinen L"}, {"clean": "Pulkki-R\u00e5back L"}, {"clean": "Raitakari O"}, {"clean": "Realo A"}, {"clean": "Rose R"}, {"clean": "Ruggiero D"}, {"clean": "Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 I"}, {"clean": "Slutske W"}, {"clean": "Smyth D"}, {"clean": "Sorice R"}, {"clean": "Starr J"}, {"clean": "Sutin A"}, {"clean": "Tanaka T"}, {"clean": "Verhagen J"}, {"clean": "Vermeulen S"}, {"clean": "Vuoksimaa E"}, {"clean": "Widen E"}, {"clean": "Willemsen G"}, {"clean": "Wright M"}, {"clean": "Zgaga L"}, {"clean": "Rujescu D"}, {"clean": "Metspalu A"}, {"clean": "Wilson J"}, {"clean": "Ciullo M"}, {"clean": "Hayward C"}, {"clean": "Rudan I"}, {"clean": "Deary I"}, {"clean": "R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen K"}, {"clean": "Arias Vasquez A"}, {"clean": "Costa P"}, {"clean": "Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen L"}, {"clean": "van Duijn C"}, {"clean": "Penninx B"}, {"clean": "Krueger R"}, {"clean": "Evans D"}, {"clean": "Kaprio J"}, {"clean": "Pedersen N"}, {"clean": "Martin N"}, {"clean": "Boomsma D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Behav.
