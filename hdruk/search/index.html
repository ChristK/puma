This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there is a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes.The SPIRIT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI. Both guidelines were developed using a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted on by an international multi-stakeholder group in a 2-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants).The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations around the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases.SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Artificial Intelligence", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Checklist", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Clinical Protocols", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Clinical Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Consensus", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Research Design", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Rivera S"}, {"clean": "Liu X"}, {"clean": "Chan A"}, {"clean": "Denniston A"}, {"clean": "Calvert M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ", "volume": "370", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "24F444YQ", "DOI": "10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30133-X", "DOI_filename": "a1c65868f3d8e0ddcb90bcea977c829e", "PMID": "32502389", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85086675142", "hash": "188b8b56b206cd2bed5993dd3e976548"}, "clean": {"title": "Effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and demand for hospital services in the UK: a modelling study.", "abstract": "['Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been crucial to support evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK.', 'We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66\u00b74 million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.', 'We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23 million (95% prediction interval 13-30) clinical cases and 350\\u2008000 deaths (170\\u2008000-480\\u2008000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; near or below 1; the most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120\\u2008000 cases (46\\u2008000-700\\u2008000) and 50\\u2008000 deaths (9300-160\\u2008000).

Hazard ratios between 24-hour sodium excretion were estimated from spot urinary sodium concentrations across incident CVD and its components and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In restricted cubic splines analyses, there was little evidence for an association between estimated 24-hour sodium excretion and CVD, coronary heart disease, or stroke; hazard ratios for CVD (95% CIs) for the 15th and 85th percentiles (2.5 and 4.2 g/day, respectively) compared with the 50th percentile of estimated sodium excretion (3.2 g/day) were 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 0.96 (0.92-1.00), respectively. An inverse association was observed with heart failure, but that was no longer apparent in sensitivity analysis. A J-shaped association was observed between estimated sodium excretion and mortality. Our findings do not support a J-shaped association of estimated sodium excretion with CVD, although such an association was apparent for all-cause and cause-specific mortality across a wide range of diseases.

The study population comprised 13,577 and 4,966 mothers of infants with NAS and 4,205,675 and 929,985 control mothers in England and Ontario, respectively. Death records captured all-cause maternal mortality after delivery through March 31, 2016, and cause-specific maternal mortality to December 31, 2014. The primary exposure was a live birth of an infant with NAS, and the main outcome was all deaths among mothers following their date of delivery. We modelled the association between NAS and all-cause maternal mortality using Cox regression, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality within a competing risks framework. All-cause mortality rates, 10-year cumulative incidence risk of death, and crude and age-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated. Estimated crude 10-year mortality based on Kaplan-Meier curves in mothers of infants with NAS was 5.1% (95% CI 4.7%-5.6%) in England and 4.6% (95% CI 3.8%-5.5%) in Ontario versus 0.4% (95% CI 0.41%-0.42%) in England and 0.4% (95% CI 0.38%-0.41%) in Ontario for controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). Survival curves showed no clear inflection point or period of heightened risk. The crude hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 12.1 (95% 11.1-13.2; p &lt; 0.001) in England and 11.4 (9.7-13.4; p &lt; 0.001) in Ontario; age adjustment did not reduce the hazard ratios. The cumulative incidence of death was higher among NAS mothers than controls for almost all causes of death. The majority of deaths were by avoidable causes, defined as those that are preventable, amenable to care, or both. Limitations included lack of direct measures of maternal opioid use, other substance misuse, and treatments or supports received.', 'In this study, we found that approximately 1 in 20 mothers of infants with NAS died within 10 years of delivery in both England and Canada-a mortality risk 11-12 times higher than for control mothers. Risk of death was not limited to the early postpartum period targeted by most public health programs.

We show that: (A) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression than did the top cis-eQTL (median 2-fold improvement); (B) predicted expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (false discovery rate &lt; 0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite pairs, but, after stepwise conditional analyses, 90% were dominated by a single eQTL SNP; (C) among the 35% of associations where a SNP in the expression model was a significant cis-eQTL and metabolomic-QTL (met-QTL), 92% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in multi-SNP models; and (D) using a \"truth\" set of causal genes at 61 met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67%), but the positive predictive value was low, as only 8% of TWAS associations (19% when restricted to colocalized associations at met-QTLs) involved true causal genes. These results guide the interpretation of TWAS and highlight the need for corroborative data to provide confident assignment of causality.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Gene Expression Regulation", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Metabolome", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Models, Genetic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Phenotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Quantitative Trait Loci", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Transcriptome", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Ndungu A"}, {"clean": "Payne A"}, {"clean": "Torres J"}, {"clean": "van de Bunt M"}, {"clean": "McCarthy M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Am J Hum Genet", "volume": "106", "issue": "2"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "35GLAGM9", "DOI": "10.1177/2047487319877078", "DOI_filename": "3698671cc7c130896ec251967c9eb909", "PMID": "31619084", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85074338122", "hash": "d035d8e012e05a710b13d76e387aea71"}, "clean": {"title": "Progression of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and vascular disease risk in individuals: insights from the PROG-IMT consortium.", "abstract": "['Averaged measurements, but not the progression based on multiple assessments of carotid intima-media thickness, (cIMT) are predictive of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in individuals.

Each of the models pertaining to diet healthiness, physical exercise, or a combination of both displayed a metabolic and functional microbial signature, with a significant proportion of the metabolites identified as discriminating between the various pairwise comparisons resulting from gut microbe-host cometabolism. Microbial diversity was associated with a combination of high adherence to healthy dietary habits and exercise and was correlated with a distinct array of microbially derived metabolites, including markers of proteolytic activity. Improved control of dietary confounders, through the use of an objective dietary assessment score, has uncovered further insights into the complex, multifactorial relationship between diet, exercise, the gut microbiome, and metabolism.

Nevertheless, despite such interventions, considerable risks for kidney and CV complications remain. Recently, large placebo-controlled outcome trials have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce the risk of CV disease (including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure) in people with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of atherosclerotic disease, and these effects were largely independent of improvements in hyperglycaemia, BP and body weight. In the kidney, increased sodium delivery to the macula densa mediated by SGLT-2 inhibition has the potential to reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may explain why SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce albuminuria and appear to slow kidney function decline in people with diabetes. Importantly, in the trials completed to date, these benefits appeared to be maintained at lower levels of kidney function, despite attenuation of glycosuric effects, and did not appear to be dependent on ambient hyperglycaemia. There is therefore a rationale for studying the cardio-renal effects of SGLT-2 inhibition in people at risk of CV disease and hyperfiltration (i.e. those with substantially reduced nephron mass and/or albuminuria), irrespective of whether they have diabetes.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Herrington W"}, {"clean": "Preiss D"}, {"clean": "Haynes R"}, {"clean": "von Eynatten M"}, {"clean": "Staplin N"}, {"clean": "Hauske S"}, {"clean": "George J"}, {"clean": "Green J"}, {"clean": "Landray M"}, {"clean": "Baigent C"}, {"clean": "Wanner C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Clin Kidney J", "volume": "11", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "3YZTPL2W", "DOI": "10.3791/60794", "DOI_filename": "1dcf47d88e2e4d2903ef1b5bba9f74cc", "PMID": "32478737", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85084857447", "hash": "78ace75dc4ea797099bd53e5f63dcfea"}, "clean": {"title": "Implementation of a Real-Time Psychosis Risk Detection and Alerting System Based on Electronic Health Records using CogStack.", "abstract": "[\"Recent studies have shown that an automated, lifespan-inclusive, transdiagnostic, and clinically based, individualized risk calculator provides a powerful system for supporting the early detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis at a large scale, by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs).

We made several methodological improvements compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the overall risk to individual health.', 'Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 2\u00b72% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1\u00b75-3\u00b70) of age-standardised female deaths and 6\u00b78% (5\u00b78-8\u00b70) of age-standardised male deaths.

In this work, we summarize methods to estimate the optimal ITR in the multi-arm setting and compare their performance in large-scale clinical trials via simulation studies.

However, this characterisation remains incomplete and the non-obvious features of this topology have largely confounded attempts towards comprehensive constructive modelling. This calls for new perspectives. Hierarchical complexity is an emerging paradigm of complex network topology based on the observation that complex systems are composed of hierarchies within which the roles of hierarchically equivalent nodes display highly variable connectivity patterns. Here we test the hierarchical complexity of the human structural connectomes of a group of seventy-nine healthy adults. Binary connectomes are found to be more hierarchically complex than three benchmark random network models. This provides a new key description of brain structure, revealing a rich diversity of connectivity patterns within hierarchically equivalent nodes. Dividing the connectomes into four tiers based on degree magnitudes indicates that the most complex nodes are neither those with the highest nor lowest degrees but are instead found in the middle tiers. Spatial mapping of the brain regions in each hierarchical tier reveals consistency with the current anatomical, functional and neuropsychological knowledge of the human brain. The most complex tier (Tier 3) involves regions believed to bridge high-order cognitive (Tier 1) and low-order sensorimotor processing (Tier 2). We then show that such diversity of connectivity patterns aligns with the diversity of functional roles played out across the brain, demonstrating that hierarchical complexity can characterise functional diversity strictly from the network topology.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Brain", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Connectome", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Nerve Net", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Neural Pathways", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Smith K"}, {"clean": "Bastin M"}, {"clean": "Cox S"}, {"clean": "Vald\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez M"}, {"clean": "Wiseman S"}, {"clean": "Escudero J"}, {"clean": "Sudlow C"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Neuroimage", "volume": "191", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "5R3UEL26", "DOI": "10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313226", "DOI_filename": "3f5cdfd6918288d1f1d924680962dbee", "PMID": "31801372", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85078556257", "hash": "8a51508e994bbf5f2d6e13b102b285ab"}, "clean": {"title": "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness: Novel Loci, Sex-Specific Effects, and Genetic Correlations With Obesity and Glucometabolic Traits in UK Biobank.", "abstract": "['Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of most cardiovascular disease, but mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis are incompletely understood.

Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, and cardiac arrhythmia.', 'Analysis included 320,798 prescriptions received by 66,331 patients. There were 3,251 deaths, 815 due to cardiovascular causes, 925 incident myocardial infarctions, 859 strokes, 637 diagnoses of peripheral vascular disease, and 1,436 cardiac arrhythmias. A non-statistically significant trend towards increased risk of myocardial infarction during the first 30 days following macrolide prescription was observed. No statistically significant short- or long-term risks were observed for macrolide prescription. No significant risks were identified for clarithromycin in particular.', 'Although not statistically significant, our best estimates suggest an increased short-term risk of myocardial infarction in patients with CRS following macrolide prescription, supporting previous observational evidence.

The results for three of these methodologies yield similar accuracy of 6.5%\\xa0to 10.5% mean absolute difference between computed and measured FFR. The main aspects of modelling which affected cFFR estimation were choice of inlet and outlet boundary conditions and estimation of flow distribution in the coronary network. One of the reduced-order models showed the lowest overall deviation from the clinical FFR measurements, indicating that reduced-order models are capable of a similar level of accuracy to a 3D model. In addition, this reduced-order model did not include a lumped pressure-drop model for a stenosis, which implies that the additional effort of isolating a stenosis and inserting a pressure-drop element in the spatial mesh may not be required for FFR estimation. The present benchmark study is the first of this kind, in which we attempt to homogenize the data required to compute FFR using mathematical models.

We performed a genome-wide association study of state anhedonia in 375,275 UK Biobank participants and assessed for genetic correlation between anhedonia and neuropsychiatric conditions (major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and Parkinson's Disease). We then used a polygenic risk score approach to test for association between genetic loading for anhedonia and both brain structure and brain function. This included: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of total grey matter volume, white matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and 15 cortical/subcortical regions of interest; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of white matter tract integrity; and functional MRI activity during an emotion processing task. We identified 11 novel loci associated at genome-wide significance with anhedonia, with a SNP heritability estimate (h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SNP) of 5.6%. Strong positive genetic correlations were found between anhedonia and major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; but not with obsessive compulsive disorder or Parkinson's Disease. Polygenic risk for anhedonia was associated with poorer brain white matter integrity, smaller total grey matter volume, and smaller volumes of brain regions linked to reward and pleasure processing, including orbito-frontal cortex. In summary, the identification of novel anhedonia-associated loci substantially expands our current understanding of the biological basis of state anhedonia and genetic correlations with several psychiatric disorders confirm the utility of this phenotype as a transdiagnostic marker of vulnerability to mental illness.

Mortality and case fatality but not event rate declined in all age groups: the stroke event rate decreased in older people but increased by 2% each year in adults aged 35 to 54 years. Of the total decline in mortality rates, 71% was attributed to the decline in case fatality (78% in men and 66% in women) and the remainder to the reduction in stroke event rates. The contribution of the two factors varied between age groups. Whereas the reduction in mortality rates in people younger than 55 years was due to the reduction in case fatality, in the oldest age group (\u226585 years) reductions in case fatality and event rates contributed nearly equally.', 'Declines in case fatality, probably driven by improvements in stroke care, contributed more than declines in event rates to the overall reduction in stroke mortality. Mortality reduction in men and women younger than 55 was solely a result of a decrease in case fatality, whereas stroke event rates increased in the age group 35 to 54 years. The increase in stroke event rates in young adults is a concern. This suggests that stroke prevention needs to be strengthened to reduce the occurrence of stroke in people younger than 55 years.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Age Distribution", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Databases, Factual", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hospitalization", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mortality", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Stroke", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Seminog O"}, {"clean": "Scarborough P"}, {"clean": "Wright F"}, {"clean": "Rayner M"}, {"clean": "Goldacre M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ", "volume": "365", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "7EG6WNIP", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0217158", "DOI_filename": "582ddbb24fc2905778e5ee7026257a1b", "PMID": "31163036", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85066619269", "hash": "d3a935b92c3d14f56acdb755dbeeb8de"}, "clean": {"title": "Differences in the epidemiology of out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths.", "abstract": "['Trauma is a leading cause of mortality.

We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030.

In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was $20\u00b72 billion (17\u00b70-25\u00b70) and on tuberculosis it was $10\u00b79 billion (10\u00b73-11\u00b78), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was $5\u00b71 billion (4\u00b79-5\u00b74).

Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81\u00b76% (81\u00b76-81\u00b77) in 2015 to 83\u00b71% (82\u00b78-83\u00b73) in 2030.', 'Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes.

Participants were recruited 12-months after admission to a major trauma service for a compensable transport or workplace injury (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 157). Injury, compensation claim, health services and medication information were obtained from the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcome Registry, Victorian State Trauma Registry and Compensation Research Database. Participants completed questionnaires about pain, and mental health (anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder) at 12 months post-injury. One third had disabling pain, one third had at least one probable mental health condition and more than one in five had both disabling pain and a mental health condition at 12 months post-injury. Multivariable logistic regression found mental health treatment 3-6 months post-injury, persistent work disability and opioid use at 6-12 months predicted disabling pain at 12 months post-injury.

Fucose depletion is known to potentiate strong antibody-mediated NK cell activation and enhanced target antigen-expressing cell killing. In autoimmunity, this may translate to autoantibody-mediated immune cell recruitment and attack of self-antigen expressing normal tissues. Hence, we investigated the crosstalk between immune cell traits, secreted proteins, genetic variants and the glycosylation patterns of serum IgG, in a multi-omic and cross-sectional study of 622 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort, 172 of whom were diagnosed with AITD. We observed associations between two genetic variants (rs505922 and rs687621), AITD status, the secretion of Desmoglein-2 protein, and the profile of two IgG N-glycan traits in AITD, but further studies need to be performed to better understand their crosstalk in AITD.

Patient demographics, injury severity and event characteristics, surgical intervention and in-hospital outcomes were investigated.', 'There were 2394 burn-injured older adults admitted during the study period, accounting for 13.4% of adult admissions. Scalds were the most common cause of burn injury in older adults. The incidence of older adult burns increased by 2.96% each year (incidence rate ratio = 1.030, 95% confidence interval = 1.013-1.046, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). Compared to their younger peers, a smaller proportion of older adult patients were taken to theatre for a surgical procedure, though a larger proportion of older adults received a skin graft.', 'Differences in patient and injury characteristics, surgical management and in-hospital outcomes were observed for older adults. These findings provide the Australian and New Zealand burn care community with a greater understanding of burn injury and their treatments in a unique group of patients who are at risk of poorer outcomes than younger people.', 'The number and proportion of older persons in every country of the world is growing. This may create challenges for healthcare systems. While burn injuries are a unique subset of trauma that affect individuals of all ages, less is known about burns in older adults and how they differ from younger patients.We wanted to look at the number, type, management, and outcomes of burns in older adults in Australia and New Zealand. To do this, we used data from the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand, or BRANZ. The BRANZ is a database that collects information on patients that present to Australian and New Zealand hospitals that have a specialist burns unit.Our research found that one in eight adult burns patients was over the age of 65, and that the rate of burn injuries in older adults has increased over the last decade. Older adult burns patients were most commonly affected by scalds after coming in contact with wet heat such as boiling liquids or steam. Fewer older adults went to theatre for an operation or surgical procedure compared to their younger counterparts. However, a larger proportion of older adults that went to theatre had a skin graft (where skin is removed from an uninjured part of the body and placed over the injured part).This research provides important information about a unique and growing group of patients to the local burn care community. It also highlights potential avenues for injury prevention initiatives.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Tracy L"}, {"clean": "Singer Y"}, {"clean": "Schrale R"}, {"clean": "Gong J"}, {"clean": "Darton A"}, {"clean": "Wood F"}, {"clean": "Kurmis R"}, {"clean": "Edgar D"}, {"clean": "Cleland H"}, {"clean": "Gabbe B"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Scars Burn Heal", "volume": "6", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "8MP94WHR", "DOI": "10.1136/archdischild-2019-317902", "DOI_filename": "1db9598349212ceb9c4583773565fe9c", "PMID": "32444447", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85085315524", "hash": "4b645f38e20b3b19b82cef40e0bf4130"}, "clean": {"title": "Emergency paediatric critical care in England: describing trends using routine hospital data.", "abstract": "['To determine trends in emergency admission rates requiring different levels of critical care in hospitals with and without a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).', 'Birth cohort study created from Hospital Episode Statistics.', 'National Health Service funded hospitals in England.', '8\\u2009577\\u2009680 singleton children born between 1 May 2003 and 31 April 2017.', 'Using procedure and diagnostic codes, we assigned indicators of high dependency care (eg, non-invasive ventilation) or intensive care (eg, invasive ventilation) to emergency admissions.', 'Children were followed up until their fifth birthday to estimate high dependency and intensive care admission rates in hospitals with and without a PICU.

The objective of this study was to explore the broad clinical effects of varying iron status.', 'Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data obtained from 48,972 European individuals (55% female) across 19 cohorts in the Genetics of Iron Status Consortium were used to identify 3 genetic variants (rs1800562 and rs1799945 in the hemochromatosis gene [HFE] and rs855791 in the transmembrane protease serine 6 gene [TMPRSS6]) that associate with increased serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation and decreased transferrin levels, thus serving as instruments for systemic iron status. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of these instruments was performed on 424,439 European individuals (54% female) in the UK Biobank who were aged 40-69 years when recruited from 2006 to 2010, with their genetic data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from April, 1995 to March, 2016. Two-sample summary data mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the effect of varying iron status on outcomes across the human phenome. MR-PheWAS analysis for the 3 iron status genetic instruments was performed separately and then pooled by meta-analysis. Correction was made for testing of multiple correlated phenotypes using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Heterogeneity between MR estimates for different instruments was used to indicate possible bias due to effects of the genetic variants through pathways unrelated to iron status. There were 904 distinct phenotypes included in the MR-PheWAS analyses. After correcting for multiple testing, the 3 genetic instruments for systemic iron status demonstrated consistent evidence of a causal effect of higher iron status on decreasing risk of traits related to anemia (iron deficiency anemia: odds ratio [OR] scaled to a standard deviation [SD] increase in genetically determined serum iron levels 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.81, P = 4 \u00d7 10-8) and hypercholesterolemia (hypercholesterolemia: OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, P = 2 \u00d7 10-5) and increasing risk of traits related to infection of the skin and related structures (cellulitis and abscess of the leg: OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.42, P = 6 \u00d7 10-4). The main limitations of this study relate to possible bias from pleiotropic effects of the considered genetic variants and misclassification of diagnoses in the HES data. Furthermore, this work only investigated participants with European ancestry, and the findings may not be applicable to other ethnic groups.', 'Our findings offer novel, to our knowledge, insight into previously unreported effects of iron status, highlighting a potential protective effect of higher iron status on hypercholesterolemia and a detrimental role on risk of skin and skin structure infections.

Random allocation was done with a web-based program, which was centrally controlled to ensure allocation concealment.

However, participant inclusion in analyses and occurrence of outcome events were determined following an analysis plan that was specified before individuals saw the unblinded data. The primary outcome was the time from random allocation to first microbiologically confirmed bloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection between 24 h after randomisation and 48 h after PICC removal or death. We analysed outcome data according to the intention-to-treat principle.

We estimate the reductions needed in modifiable risk factors for individuals with different levels of genomic risk and suggest that, for individuals with high metaGRS, achieving risk factor levels recommended by current guidelines may be insufficient to mitigate risk.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Blood Pressure", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Body Mass Index", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Brain Ischemia", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Comorbidity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Datasets as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical History Taking", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Predictive Value of Tests", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Assessment", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Smoking", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Abraham G"}, {"clean": "Malik R"}, {"clean": "Yonova-Doing E"}, {"clean": "Salim A"}, {"clean": "Wang T"}, {"clean": "Danesh J"}, {"clean": "Butterworth A"}, {"clean": "Howson J"}, {"clean": "Inouye M"}, {"clean": "Dichgans M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Nat Commun", "volume": "10", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "A5HNF2XT", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32207-4", "DOI_filename": "1b164026f8960f5d2b288e412efc768c", "PMID": "30497795", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85055992428", "hash": "62f9117a74f234244420458427ca1595"}, "clean": {"title": "Changes in health in the countries of the UK and 150 English Local Authority areas 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.", "abstract": "['Previous studies have reported national and regional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates for the UK. Because of substantial variation in health within the UK, action to improve it requires comparable estimates of disease burden and risks at country and local levels. The slowdown in the rate of improvement in life expectancy requires further investigation. We use GBD 2016 data on mortality, causes of death, and disability to analyse the burden of disease in the countries of the UK and within local authorities in England by deprivation quintile.', 'We extracted data from the GBD 2016 to estimate years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and attributable risks from 1990 to 2016 for England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the UK, and 150 English Upper-Tier Local Authorities. We estimated the burden of disease by cause of death, condition, year, and sex. We analysed the association between burden of disease and socioeconomic deprivation using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We present results for all 264 GBD causes of death combined and the leading 20 specific causes, and all 84 GBD risks or risk clusters combined and 17 specific risks or risk clusters.', \"The leading causes of age-adjusted YLLs in all UK countries in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, lung cancers, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Age-standardised rates of YLLs for all causes varied by two times between local areas in England according to levels of socioeconomic deprivation (from 14\\u2008274 per 100\\u2008000 population [95% uncertainty interval 12\\u2008791-15\\u2008875] in Blackpool to 6888 [6145-7739] in Wokingham). Some Upper-Tier Local Authorities, particularly those in London, did better than expected for their level of deprivation. Allowing for differences in age structure, more deprived Upper-Tier Local Authorities had higher attributable YLLs for most major risk factors in the GBD. The population attributable fractions for all-cause YLLs for individual major risk factors varied across Upper-Tier Local Authorities. Life expectancy and YLLs have improved more slowly since 2010 in all UK countries compared with 1990-2010. In nine of 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities, YLLs increased after 2010. For attributable YLLs, the rate of improvement slowed most substantially for cardiovascular disease and breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, and showed little change for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Morbidity makes an increasing contribution to overall burden in the UK compared with mortality. The age-standardised UK DALY rate for low back and neck pain (1795 [1258-2356]) was higher than for ischaemic heart disease (1200 [1155-1246]) or lung cancer (660 [642-679]). The leading causes of ill health (measured through YLDs) in the UK in 2016 were low back and neck pain, skin and subcutaneous diseases, migraine, depressive disorders, and sense organ disease. Age-standardised YLD rates varied much less than equivalent YLL rates across the UK, which reflects the relative scarcity of local data on causes of ill health.\", 'These estimates at local, regional, and national level will allow policy makers to match resources and priorities to levels of burden and risk factors. Improvement in YLLs and life expectancy slowed notably after 2010, particularly in cardiovascular disease and cancer, and targeted actions are needed if the rate of improvement is to recover. A targeted policy response is also required to address the increasing proportion of burden due to morbidity, such as musculoskeletal problems and depression.

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders.', \"We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach.\", \"Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247-308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9\u00b70 million [8\u00b78-9\u00b74]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34-44] and DALYs by 15% [9-21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26-30] and DALYs by 27% [24-31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42\u00b72% [38\u00b76-46\u00b71]), migraine (16\u00b73% [11\u00b77-20\u00b78]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10\u00b74% [9\u00b70-12\u00b71]), and meningitis (7\u00b79% [6\u00b76-10\u00b74]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1\u00b712 [1\u00b705-1\u00b720]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0\u00b77. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88\u00b78% (86\u00b75-90\u00b79) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22\u00b73% [11\u00b78-35\u00b71] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14\u00b71% [10\u00b78-17\u00b75] of DALYs are risk attributable).\", 'Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase.

In this study, we used two methods, namely the MIDER (Mutual Information Distance and Entropy Reduction) and the PLSNET (Partial least square based feature selection) methods, to infer the structure of a GRN directly from data and computationally validated our results. Both methods were applied to different gene expression datasets resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) studies.

FDR is related to the proportion of true relationships available for discovery (\u03b3), and the type 1 (false-positive) and type 2 (false negative) error rates of the experiments designed to uncover them. We estimated the FDR in preclinical science, its effect on drug development success rates, and improvements expected from use of human genomics rather than preclinical studies as the primary source of evidence for drug target identification. Calculations were based on a sample space defined by all human diseases - the 'disease-ome' - represented as columns; and all protein coding genes - 'the protein-coding genome'- represented as rows, producing a matrix of unique gene- (or protein-) disease pairings. We parameterised the space based on 10,000 diseases, 20,000 protein-coding genes, 100 causal genes per disease and 4000 genes encoding druggable targets, examining the effect of varying the parameters and a range of underlying assumptions, on the inferences drawn. We estimated \u03b3, defined mathematical relationships between preclinical FDR and drug development success rates, and estimated improvements in success rates based on human genomics (rather than orthodox preclinical studies). Around one in every 200 protein-disease pairings was estimated to be causal (\u03b3\\u2009=\\u20090.005) giving an FDR in preclinical research of 92.6%, which likely makes a major contribution to the reported drug development failure rate of 96%.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R0 is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Asymptomatic Infections", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Betacoronavirus", "major": "N"}, {"term": "COVID-19", "major": "N"}, {"term": "China", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Computational Biology", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Contact Tracing", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Coronavirus Infections", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Disease Outbreaks", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Forecasting", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Pandemics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pneumonia, Viral", "major": "N"}, {"term": "SARS-CoV-2", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Virus Replication", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Hilton J"}, {"clean": "Keeling M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS Comput Biol", "volume": "16", "issue": "7"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "AM7YQP9W", "DOI": "10.1002/pds.5121", "DOI_filename": "a27fca7f0e95a83f8d2f9f8e023eb250", "PMID": "32926504", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85090935609", "hash": "80edae26e448892b05bbf8877f8a2d5a"}, "clean": {"title": "Implementing high-dimensional propensity score principles to improve confounder adjustment in UK electronic health records.", "abstract": "['Recent evidence from US claims data suggests use of high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) methods improve adjustment for confounding in non-randomised studies of interventions.

Our aims were to (1) analyze the early discontinuation rate of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists post-percutaneous coronary intervention, (2) explore factors associated with early discontinuation, and (3) analyze the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization, or stroke) associated with discontinuation from a prespecified prescribing instruction of 1\\xa0year. Method and Results We studied 2090 patients (2011-2015) who were recommended for clopidogrel for 12\\xa0months (+aspirin) post-percutaneous coronary intervention within a retrospective observational population cohort. Relationships between clopidogrel discontinuation and major adverse cardiac events were evaluated over 18-month follow-up. Discontinuation of clopidogrel in the first 4 quarters was low at 1.1%, 2.6%, 3.7%, and 6.1%, respectively. Previous revascularization, previous ischemic stroke, and age &gt;80\\xa0years were independent predictors of early discontinuation. In a time-dependent multiple regression model, clopidogrel discontinuation and bleeding (hazard ratio=1.82 [1.01-3.30] and hazard ratio=5.30 [3.14-8.94], respectively) were independent predictors of major adverse cardiac events as were age &lt;49 and \u226570\\xa0years (versus those aged 50-59\\xa0years), hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage 4+, previous revascularization, ischemic stroke, and thromboembolism. Furthermore, in those with both bleeding and clopidogrel discontinuation, hazard ratio for major adverse cardiac events was 9.34 (3.39-25.70). Conclusions Discontinuation of clopidogrel is low in the first year post-percutaneous coronary intervention, where a clear discharge instruction to treat for 1\\xa0year is provided. Whereas this is reassuring from the population level, at an individual level discontinuation earlier than the intended duration is associated with an increased rate of adverse events, most notably in those with both bleeding and discontinuation.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Age Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Clopidogrel", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Drug Prescriptions", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hemorrhage", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hypertension", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medication Adherence", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Retreatment", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Retrospective Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Stroke", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Thromboembolism", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Wales", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Harris D"}, {"clean": "Lacey A"}, {"clean": "Akbari A"}, {"clean": "Obaid D"}, {"clean": "Smith D"}, {"clean": "Jenkins G"}, {"clean": "Barry J"}, {"clean": "Gravenor M"}, {"clean": "Halcox J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Am Heart Assoc", "volume": "8", "issue": "21"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "AU6U5QBM", "DOI": "10.3389/fgene.2019.00922", "DOI_filename": "66c245f83f17ca9de69cbaa96035fbcc", "PMID": "31616478", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85073143787", "hash": "bfbadd096dd96ed4c08a1ce91b24c5c2"}, "clean": {"title": "Machine Learning Predicts Accurately &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; Drug Resistance From Whole Genome Sequencing Data.", "abstract": "['&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Tuberculosis disease, caused by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, is a major public health problem. The emergence of &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; strains resistant to existing treatments threatens to derail control efforts. Resistance is mainly conferred by mutations in genes coding for drug targets or converting enzymes, but our knowledge of these mutations is incomplete. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is an increasingly common approach to rapidly characterize isolates and identify mutations predicting antimicrobial resistance and thereby providing a diagnostic tool to assist clinical decision making. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; We applied machine learning approaches to 16,688 &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates that have undergone WGS and laboratory drug-susceptibility testing (DST) across 14 antituberculosis drugs, with 22.5% of samples being multidrug resistant and 2.1% being extensively drug resistant. We used non-parametric classification-tree and gradient-boosted-tree models to predict drug resistance and uncover any associated novel putative mutations. We fitted separate models for each drug, with and without \"co-occurrent resistance\" markers known to be causing resistance to drugs other than the one of interest. Predictive performance was measured using sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, assuming DST results as the gold standard. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The predictive performance was highest for resistance to first-line drugs, amikacin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 96%), and lowest for third-line drugs such as D-cycloserine and Para-aminosalisylic acid (area under the curve below 85%). The inclusion of co-occurrent resistance markers led to improved performance for some drugs and superior results when compared to similar models in other large-scale studies, which had smaller sample sizes. Overall, the gradient-boosted-tree models performed better than the classification-tree models. The mutation-rank analysis detected no new single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to drug resistance. Discordance between DST and genotypically inferred resistance may be explained by DST errors, novel rare mutations, hetero-resistance, and nongenomic drivers such as efflux-pump upregulation. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Our work demonstrates the utility of machine learning as a flexible approach to drug resistance prediction that is able to accommodate a much larger number of predictors and to summarize their predictive ability, thus assisting clinical decision making and single nucleotide polymorphism detection in an era of increasing WGS data generation.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Deelder W"}, {"clean": "Christakoudi S"}, {"clean": "Phelan J"}, {"clean": "Benavente E"}, {"clean": "Campino S"}, {"clean": "McNerney R"}, {"clean": "Palla L"}, {"clean": "Clark T"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Front Genet", "volume": "10", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "AU9DLVVQ", "DOI": "10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-215566", "DOI_filename": "77d3d96e70f7544bc84c51255327a80e", "PMID": "32895316", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85090934725", "hash": "6751860913d940c82e5ca2ed83138db5"}, "clean": {"title": "We need a robust evidence base to unravel the relationship between sex hormones and asthma.", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Asthma", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sheikh A"}, {"clean": "Mukherjee M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Thorax", "volume": "75", "issue": "10"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "AZUN9U2B", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jaad.2019.08.039", "DOI_filename": "51e0eb70e291f63ba9444ca320b5d654", "PMID": "31442537", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85078937252", "hash": "8f761d30c59bd8d7fde8e42a8b59ba25"}, "clean": {"title": "Atopic dermatitis and risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter: A 35-year follow-up study.", "abstract": "['Atopic dermatitis is characterized by chronic inflammation, which is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.', 'To examine the association between hospital-diagnosed atopic dermatitis and atrial fibrillation.', 'Using linked population-based Danish registries, we identified persons with an inpatient or outpatient hospital diagnosis of atopic dermatitis during 1977-2013 and a comparison cohort individually matched to the atopic dermatitis cohort.

We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection-hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies.', 'We estimated that 1\u00b77 billion (UI 1\u00b70-2\u00b74) people, comprising 22% (UI 15-28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from &lt;5% of those younger than 20 years to &gt;66% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186-787) people (4% [3-9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from &lt;1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6% (3-12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2-7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease.', 'About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.', 'UK Department for International Development, Wellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Medical Research Council, and National Institute for Health Research.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "COVID-19", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Child, Preschool", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Chronic Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Coronavirus Infections", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Global Health", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pandemics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pneumonia, Viral", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Assessment", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Severity of Illness Index", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}, {"term": "United States", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Clark A"}, {"clean": "Jit M"}, {"clean": "Warren-Gash C"}, {"clean": "Guthrie B"}, {"clean": "Wang H"}, {"clean": "Mercer S"}, {"clean": "Sanderson C"}, {"clean": "McKee M"}, {"clean": "Troeger C"}, {"clean": "Ong K"}, {"clean": "Checchi F"}, {"clean": "Perel P"}, {"clean": "Joseph S"}, {"clean": "Gibbs H"}, {"clean": "Banerjee A"}, {"clean": "Eggo R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Lancet Glob Health", "volume": "8", "issue": "8"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "CKIDMYJT", "DOI": "10.1186/s12911-020-01169-z", "DOI_filename": "783dc0c6eb9aa9713f0bb2083755d3fd", "PMID": "32635913", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85087720051", "hash": "b43d2b7c19b502bd7d157b40dc7b23b3"}, "clean": {"title": "Application of standardised effect sizes to hospital discharge outcomes for people with diabetes.", "abstract": "['Patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of readmission and mortality when discharged from hospital.

The ability to detect the majority of at-risk individuals is the main barrier toward extending benefits for the lives of many adolescents and young adults. Current detection strategies are highly inefficient. Only 5% (standalone specialized early detection services) to 12% (youth mental health services) of individuals who will develop a first psychotic disorder can be detected at the time of their at-risk stage. To overcome these challenges a pragmatic, clinically-based, individualized, transdiagnostic risk calculator has been developed to detect individuals at-risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care at scale. This calculator has been externally validated and has demonstrated good prognostic performance. However, it is not known whether it can be used in the real world clinical routine. For example, clinicians may not be willing to adhere to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator. Implementation studies are needed to address pragmatic challenges relating to the real world use of the transdiagnostic risk calculator. The aim of the current study is to provide &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; feasibility data to support the implementation of the transdiagnostic risk calculator in clinical routine. &lt;b&gt;Method:&lt;/b&gt; This is a study which comprises of two subsequent phases: an &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; phase of 1 month and an &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; phase of 11 months. The &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; phase aims at developing and integrating the transdiagnostic risk calculator in the local electronic health register (primary outcome). The &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; phase aims at addressing the clinicians' adherence to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator (primary outcome) and other secondary feasibility parameters that are necessary to estimate the resources needed for its implementation. &lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; This is the first implementation study for risk prediction models in individuals at-risk for psychosis. Ultimately, successful implementation is the true measure of a prediction model's utility. Therefore, the overall translational deliverable of the current study would be to extend the benefits of primary indicated prevention and improve outcomes of first episode psychosis.

This paper presents a novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a classifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in streaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively compared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme, single-classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed active scheme based ensemble learning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in MI classifications.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Raza H"}, {"clean": "Rathee D"}, {"clean": "Zhou S"}, {"clean": "Cecotti H"}, {"clean": "Prasad G"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Neurocomputing", "volume": "343", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "CTVG5SA3", "DOI": "10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30410-4", "DOI_filename": "067f170d0637b5a3f27588b1fb44636e", "PMID": "31678026", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85076678739", "hash": "eb33a5fbb2b8b425a5c2a7381a582003"}, "clean": {"title": "Quantifying risks and interventions that have affected the burden of lower respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.", "abstract": "['Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases.

Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype 'chronic pain grade', have been shown previously to be complex heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individual's overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the UK general population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP in ~380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits, including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. Overall, our findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component with implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain.

Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients. Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts).

Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients discharged under cardiology (69%). Electronic health record text can be used for automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale.

Central to the TM vision is to narrow the gap between basic science and applied science in terms of time, cost and early diagnosis of the disease state. Biomarker identification is one of the main challenges within TM. The identification of disease biomarkers from -omics data will not only help the stratification of diverse patient cohorts but will also provide early diagnostic information which could improve patient management and potentially prevent adverse outcomes. However, biomarker identification needs to be robust and reproducible. Hence a robust unbiased computational framework that can help clinicians identify those biomarkers is necessary.', 'We developed a pipeline (workflow) that includes two different supervised classification techniques based on regularization methods to identify biomarkers from -omics or other high dimension clinical datasets. The pipeline includes several important steps such as quality control and stability of selected biomarkers. The process takes input files (outcome and independent variables or -omics data) and pre-processes (normalization, missing values) them. After a random division of samples into training and test sets, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Elastic Net feature selection methods are applied to identify the most important features representing potential biomarker candidates. The penalization parameters are optimised using 10-fold cross validation and the process undergoes 100 iterations and a combinatorial analysis to select the best performing multivariate model. An empirical unbiased assessment of their quality as biomarkers for clinical use is performed through a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and its Area Under the Curve analysis on both permuted and real data for 1000 different randomized training and test sets. We validated this pipeline against previously published biomarkers.', 'We applied this pipeline to three different datasets with previously published biomarkers: lipidomics data by Acharjee et al.

However, functional aging is heterogeneous. Frailty is a negative health status and is more common in older adults. We hypothesized that neutrophil migration may be compromised in frailty, associated with the degree of frailty experienced by the older person. We compared measures of frailty, neutrophil function, and systemic inflammation in 40 young and 77 older community-dwelling adults in the United Kingdom. Systemic neutrophils exhibited an age-associated reduction in the accuracy of migration (chemotaxis) which was further blunted with frailty. The degree of migratory inaccuracy correlated with physical (adjusted hand grip strength) and cognitive (Stroop test) markers of frailty. Regression analysis demonstrated that age, Charlson comorbidity index, and frailty index were able to predict neutrophil chemotaxis. Reduced chemotaxis of neutrophils from frail adults could be reversed using selective PI3K inhibitors. Exposure of neutrophils from young adults to plasma from chronically inflamed frail older adults could not recapitulate the migratory deficit in vitro, and there were no relationships with systemic inflammation and neutrophil dysfunction. Frailty exaggerated the neutrophil deficits seen with advanced age but aspects of the frailty-associated deficit in neutrophil function are rescuable and thus potentially form a therapeutic target to improve outcomes from infection in older adults.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Wilson D"}, {"clean": "Drew W"}, {"clean": "Jasper A"}, {"clean": "Crisford H"}, {"clean": "Nightingale P"}, {"clean": "Newby P"}, {"clean": "Jackson T"}, {"clean": "Lord J"}, {"clean": "Sapey E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci", "volume": "75", "issue": "12"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ETQURYPP", "DOI": "10.1016/j.bbi.2019.05.009", "DOI_filename": "fb47cb9d3b7f385511c64e361a44b136", "PMID": "31063847", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85065596053", "hash": "1177e3a40536527a07f479def6e6daf9"}, "clean": {"title": "Transcriptomic analysis of probable asymptomatic and symptomatic alzheimer brains.", "abstract": "['Individuals with intact cognition and neuropathology consistent with Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are referred to as asymptomatic AD (AsymAD).

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.', 'GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.', 'Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990-2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0-9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10-24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10-24 years were also in the top ten in the 25-49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50-74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.', 'As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes.

creation of a national competency framework for Clinical Informatics is required for the definition of clinical informaticians' professional attributes and skills. We aimed to systematically review the academic literature relating to competencies, skills and existing course curricula in the clinical and health related informatics domains.\", 'Two independent reviewers searched Web of Science, EMBASE, ERIC, PubMed and CINAHL. Publications were included if they reported details of relevant competencies, skills and existing course curricula. We report findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.', 'A total of 82 publications were included. The most frequently used method was surveys (30 %) followed by narrative descriptions (28 %). Most of the publications describe curriculum design (23 %) followed by competency definition (18 %) and skills, qualifications & training (18 %).

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.', 'We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.', 'Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 1\u00b75 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 2\u00b75 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 3\u00b75 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was 1\u00b75. For R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values of 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.', 'In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.

They are also more likely to have coexisting conditions, including autism and intellectual disability. We investigated prevalence of neurodevelopmental multimorbidity (\u22652 conditions) among Scottish schoolchildren and their educational outcomes compared to peers.', 'We retrospectively linked 6 Scotland-wide databases to analyse 766,244 children (390,290 [50.9%] boys; 375,954 [49.1%] girls) aged 4 to 19 years (mean = 10.9) attending Scottish schools between 2009 and 2013.

We ascertained autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities from records of additional support needs and ADHD and depression through relevant encashed prescriptions. We identified neurodevelopmental multimorbidity (\u22652 of these conditions) in 4,789 (0.6%) children, with ASD and intellectual disability the most common combination. On adjusting for sociodemographic (sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation) and maternity (maternal age, maternal smoking, sex-gestation-specific birth weight centile, gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, mode of delivery, parity) factors, multimorbidity was associated with increased school absenteeism and exclusion, unemployment, and poorer exam attainment. Significant dose relationships were evident between number of conditions (0, 1, \u22652) and the last 3 outcomes. Compared to children with no conditions, children with 1 condition, and children with 2 or more conditions, had more absenteeism (1 condition adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.27-1.30, p &lt; 0.001 and 2 or more conditions adjusted IRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.20-1.28, p &lt; 0.001), greater exclusion (adjusted IRR 2.37, 95% CI 2.25-2.48, p &lt; 0.001 and adjusted IRR 3.04, 95% CI 2.74-3.38, p &lt; 0.001), poorer attainment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.92, 95% CI 3.63-4.23, p &lt; 0.001 and adjusted OR 12.07, 95% CI 9.15-15.94, p &lt; 0.001), and increased unemployment (adjusted OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.49-1.66, p &lt; 0.001 and adjusted OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.83-2.45, p &lt; 0.001). Associations remained after further adjustment for comorbid physical conditions and additional support needs.

Without focusing exclusively on resistance markers or a clinical outbreak, we demonstrate that many hospital sink drains are abundantly and persistently colonized with diverse populations of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella oxytoca&lt;/i&gt;, including both antimicrobial-resistant and susceptible strains. Using whole-genome sequencing of 439 isolates, we show that environmental bacterial populations are largely structured by ward and sink, with only a handful of lineages, such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ST635, being widely distributed, suggesting different prevailing ecologies, which may vary as a result of different inputs and selection pressures.

A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs.', 'We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000-17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of those 250 draws.', 'While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62\u00b76%; 12\\u2008417 of 19\\u2008823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6\\u2008519\\u2008000 children (95% UI 5\\u2008254\\u2008000-7\\u2008733\\u2008000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52\\u2008230 diarrhoeal deaths (36\\u2008910-68\\u2008860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average.', \"To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities.

The secondary outcome was time to hospital admission with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Models were fitted in the derivation cohort to derive risk equations using a range of predictor variables. Performance, including measures of discrimination and calibration, was evaluated in each validation time period.', \"4384 deaths from covid-19 occurred in the derivation cohort during follow-up and 1722 in the first validation cohort period and 621 in the second validation cohort period. The final risk algorithms included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, and a range of comorbidities. The algorithm had good calibration in the first validation cohort. For deaths from covid-19 in men, it explained 73.1% (95% confidence interval 71.9% to 74.3%) of the variation in time to death (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); the D statistic was 3.37 (95% confidence interval 3.27 to 3.47), and Harrell's C was 0.928 (0.919 to 0.938). Similar results were obtained for women, for both outcomes, and in both time periods. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths within 97 days was 75.7%. People in the top 20% of predicted risk of death accounted for 94% of all deaths from covid-19.\", 'The QCOVID population based risk algorithm performed well, showing very high levels of discrimination for deaths and hospital admissions due to covid-19. The absolute risks presented, however, will change over time in line with the prevailing SARS-C0V-2 infection rate and the extent of social distancing measures in place, so they should be interpreted with caution. The model can be recalibrated for different time periods, however, and has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Aged, 80 and over", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Algorithms", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Betacoronavirus", "major": "N"}, {"term": "COVID-19", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Clinical Decision Rules", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Coronavirus Infections", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Databases, Factual", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hospitalization", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mortality", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Pandemics", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Pneumonia, Viral", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Prognosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Reproducibility of Results", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Risk Assessment", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "SARS-CoV-2", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Clift A"}, {"clean": "Coupland C"}, {"clean": "Keogh R"}, {"clean": "Diaz-Ordaz K"}, {"clean": "Williamson E"}, {"clean": "Harrison E"}, {"clean": "Hayward A"}, {"clean": "Hemingway H"}, {"clean": "Horby P"}, {"clean": "Mehta N"}, {"clean": "Benger J"}, {"clean": "Khunti K"}, {"clean": "Spiegelhalter D"}, {"clean": "Sheikh A"}, {"clean": "Valabhji J"}, {"clean": "Lyons R"}, {"clean": "Robson J"}, {"clean": "Semple M"}, {"clean": "Kee F"}, {"clean": "Johnson P"}, {"clean": "Jebb S"}, {"clean": "Williams T"}, {"clean": "Hippisley-Cox J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ", "volume": "371", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "GIRUXC6Y", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102932", "DOI_filename": "29a9fd56234611d2d9a05d0f2abd0fb7", "PMID": "32763829", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85088933440", "hash": "b8b646366b38764b1671821fb05be3f1"}, "clean": {"title": "Dietary metabolite profiling brings new insight into the relationship between nutrition and metabolic risk: An IMI DIRECT study.", "abstract": "['Dietary advice remains the cornerstone of prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Epidemiological evidence suggests that sunlight is protective against cardiovascular disease, independent of ambient temperature, but ultraviolet B-mediated vitamin D production has been discounted as causal. We aimed to determine whether ultraviolet A is associated with the seasonal patterning of myocardial infarction. Methods and Results Routine hospitalization data were used to determine monthly incidence of myocardial infarction in Scotland between 2000 and 2011. Small-area-level aggregated data were obtained on ambient temperature from the Meteorological Office and ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B irradiance from NASA satellites. Autoregressive distributed lag models were run for ultraviolet A and myocardial infarction, including adjustment for ambient temperature and ultraviolet B. Monthly incidence of myocardial infarction displayed winter peaks and summer troughs superimposed on the underlying trend, with a mean amplitude of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.41) myocardial infarctions per 100\\xa0000 population per month.

Many uterine waveform indices have been developed, which attempt to relate characteristics of the waveform with the physiological adaptation of the maternal cardiovascular system, and are often suggested to be an indicator of increased placenta resistance and arterial stiffness. Doppler waveforms of four patients, two of whom developed pre-eclampsia, are compared with a comprehensive closed-loop model of pregnancy. The closed-loop model has been previously validated but has been extended to include an improved parameter estimation technique that utilises systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, and pulse wave velocity measurements to adapt model resistances, compliances, blood volume, and the mean vessel areas in the main systemic arteries. The shape of the model-predicted uterine artery velocity waveforms showed good agreement with the characteristics observed in the patient Doppler waveforms. The personalised models obtained now allow a prediction of the uterine pressure waveforms in addition to the uterine velocity. This allows for a more detailed mechanistic analysis of the waveforms, eg, wave intensity analysis, to study existing clinical indices. The findings indicate that to accurately estimate arterial stiffness, both pulse pressure and pulse wave velocities are required. In addition, the results predict that patients who developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy have larger vessel areas in the main systemic arteries compared with the two patients who had normal pregnancy outcomes.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Carson J"}, {"clean": "Warrander L"}, {"clean": "Johnstone E"}, {"clean": "van Loon R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng", "volume": "", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "GQGQGJXQ", "DOI": "10.1093/eurheartj/ehz587", "DOI_filename": "9a418315da893e6449bcf5e46dfb1f7c", "PMID": "31504409", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85077017069", "hash": "f50507a94313fed1b6da32335871c1b0"}, "clean": {"title": "The relation between systemic inflammation and incident cancer in patients with stable cardiovascular disease: a cohort study.", "abstract": "['Low-grade inflammation, measured by elevated plasma concentrations of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4\u00d710-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7\u00d710-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0\u00d710-4) in men than women.

We also point out that neighbourhood degree sequences are related to a powerful subtree kernel for unlabeled graph classification. We study these newly defined sequence properties in a comprehensive array of graph models and over 200 real-world networks. We find that these indices are neither highly correlated with each other nor with classical network indices. Importantly, the sequences of a wide variety of real world networks are found to have greater similarity and organisation than is expected for networks of their given degree distributions. Notably, while biological, social and technological networks all showed consistently large neighbourhood similarity and organisation, hierarchical complexity was not a consistent feature of real world networks.

There were strong positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index genetic variants demonstrated effects generally consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising alleles associated with increased risk taking were associated with lower white matter integrity. Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible candidate genes.

We hypothesized that a contributory explanation is that the tumour microenvironment (TME) is not fixed due to factors such as immune cell infiltration, and that this could impair the ability of neoplastic cells to retain a high enough fitness to become a cancer. The TME has implicitly been assumed to be static in most cancer evolution models, and we therefore developed a mathematical model of spatial cancer evolution assuming that the TME, and thus the optimum cancer phenotype, changes over time. Based on simulations, we show how cancer cell populations adapt to diverse changing TME conditions and fitness landscapes. Compared with static TMEs, which generate neutral dynamics, changing TMEs lead to complex adaptations with characteristic spatio-temporal heterogeneity involving variable fitness effects of driver mutations, subclonal mixing, subclonal competition and phylogeny patterns. In many cases, cancer cell populations fail to grow or undergo spontaneous regression, and even extinction. Our analyses predict that cancer evolution in a changing TME is challenging, and can help to explain why cancer is neither inevitable nor as common as expected. Should cancer driver mutations with effects dependent of the TME exist, they are likely to be selected. Anti-cancer prevention and treatment strategies based on changing the TME are feasible and potentially effective.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Jiang X"}, {"clean": "Tomlinson I"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Open Biol", "volume": "10", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "K3CFH6CZ", "DOI": "10.1186/s12911-019-0824-x", "DOI_filename": "1577565b429fabcc6d18160c8803da08", "PMID": "31182084", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85067093024", "hash": "cc72b177f4d908b9b6f0a45b0bef2369"}, "clean": {"title": "The effect of computerized decision support systems on cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "abstract": "['Cardiovascular risk management (CVRM) is notoriously difficult because of multi-morbidity and the different phenotypes and severities of cardiovascular disease.

Moreover, TTNtv associated with dilated cardiomyopathy are estimated to be present in 0.5% of the general population. The prognosis of asymptomatic carriers of TTNtv is poorly understood because TTNtv are associated with a highly variable phenotype. We aim to assess the natural history and clinical relevance of TTNtv by analyzing standardized mortality ratios (SMR) in multigenerational pedigrees and in close relatives of present-day patients. Methods Haplotype and genealogical analyses were performed on 3 recurrent TTNtv. Subsequently, the family tree mortality ratio method was used to compare all-cause mortality of subjects at an a priori 50% risk of carrying TTNtv to the general Dutch population. SMRs were stratified for sex, age, and calendar period. Subgroups were compared with Poisson regression. Similarly, SMRs were calculated in parents of 128 present-day dilated cardiomyopathy probands with TTNtv using the reverse parent-offspring method. Results The TTNtv were established as founder mutations and traced to 18th century ancestors. In 20\\u2009522 person-years, overall mortality was not significantly increased (SMR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.18; P=0.162). However, mortality was significantly increased in subjects living after 1965 (SMR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53; P=0.009) and aged \u226560 years (SMR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35; P=0.02). The reverse parent-offspring analysis showed overall excess mortality (SMR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48; P=0.003), driven by subjects aged \u226560 years. Conclusions The natural history of the analyzed TTNtv shows a relatively mild disease course with significant excess mortality in elderly patients.

We consider assumptions under which the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences, namely, (1) no unmeasured confounding within missingness patterns; either (2a) covariate values of patients with missing data were conditionally independent of treatment or (2b) these values were conditionally independent of outcome; and (3) the outcome model is correctly specified: specifically, the true outcome model does not include interactions between missing indicators and fully observed covariates. We prove that, under the assumptions above, the missing indicator approach with outcome regression can provide unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. We use a simulation study to investigate the extent of bias in estimates of the treatment effect when the assumptions are violated and we illustrate our findings using data from electronic health records. In conclusion, the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences for outcome regression, but the plausibility of its assumptions must first be considered\\xa0carefully.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Blake H"}, {"clean": "Leyrat C"}, {"clean": "Mansfield K"}, {"clean": "Tomlinson L"}, {"clean": "Carpenter J"}, {"clean": "Williamson E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Biom J", "volume": "62", "issue": "2"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "KXMLALYH", "DOI": "10.1093/pubmed/fdz188", "DOI_filename": "e707f9e48daea2f3a02cbe5dca8b1d1f", "PMID": "31950165", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85096889268", "hash": "2d7c5e67ae5b20e1e883125cec0475b9"}, "clean": {"title": "Is child weight status correctly reported to parents?

analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.", "abstract": "['Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are increasingly recognised as global health priorities in view of the preventability of most injuries and the complex and expensive medical care they necessitate. We aimed to measure the incidence, prevalence, and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for TBI and SCI from all causes of injury in every country, to describe how these measures have changed between 1990 and 2016, and to estimate the proportion of TBI and SCI cases caused by different types of injury.', 'We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016 to measure the global, regional, and national burden of TBI and SCI by age and sex. We measured the incidence and prevalence of all causes of injury requiring medical care in inpatient and outpatient records, literature studies, and survey data. By use of clinical record data, we estimated the proportion of each cause of injury that required medical care that would result in TBI or SCI being considered as the nature of injury. We used literature studies to establish standardised mortality ratios and applied differential equations to convert incidence to prevalence of long-term disability. Finally, we applied GBD disability weights to calculate YLDs. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool for epidemiological modelling, used cause-specific mortality rates for non-fatal estimation, and adjusted our results for disability experienced with comorbid conditions. We also analysed results on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.', 'In 2016, there were 27\u00b708 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24\u00b730-30\u00b730 million) new cases of TBI and 0\u00b793 million (0\u00b778-1\u00b716 million) new cases of SCI, with age-standardised incidence rates of 369 (331-412) per 100\\u2008000 population for TBI and 13 (11-16) per 100\\u2008000 for SCI. In 2016, the number of prevalent cases of TBI was 55\u00b750 million (53\u00b740-57\u00b762 million) and of SCI was 27\u00b704 million (24\u00b798-30\u00b715 million). From 1990 to 2016, the age-standardised prevalence of TBI increased by 8\u00b74% (95% UI 7\u00b77 to 9\u00b72), whereas that of SCI did not change significantly (-0\u00b72% [-2\u00b71 to 2\u00b77]). Age-standardised incidence rates increased by 3\u00b76% (1\u00b78 to 5\u00b75) for TBI, but did not change significantly for SCI (-3\u00b76% [-7\u00b74 to 4\u00b70]). TBI caused 8\u00b71 million (95% UI 6\u00b70-10\u00b74 million) YLDs and SCI caused 9\u00b75 million (6\u00b77-12\u00b74 million) YLDs in 2016, corresponding to age-standardised rates of 111 (82-141) per 100\\u2008000 for TBI and 130 (90-170) per 100\\u2008000 for SCI. Falls and road injuries were the leading causes of new cases of TBI and SCI in most regions.', 'TBI and SCI constitute a considerable portion of the global injury burden and are caused primarily by falls and road injuries. The increase in incidence of TBI over time might continue in view of increases in population density, population ageing, and increasing use of motor vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles. The number of individuals living with SCI is expected to increase in view of population growth, which is concerning because of the specialised care that people with SCI can require. Our study was limited by data sparsity in some regions, and it will be important to invest greater resources in collection of data for TBI and SCI to improve the accuracy of future assessments.',

We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease.', 'In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER).

To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)-the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation-related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N\\u2009=\\u200912,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded 'no', 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10\\u2009=\\u20090.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]; OR for 3-4/10\\u2009=\\u20090.744 [CI 0.64-0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase.

A total of 147,334 patients were included representing 280,462 episodes of lower UTI.

After adjusting for patient demographics, year of consultation, comorbidities, smoking status, recent hospitalizations, recent accident and emergency (A&E) attendances, recent antibiotic prescribing, and home visits, the odds of BSI were equivalent in patients who were not treated with antibiotics immediately and those who were treated on the date of their UTI consultation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.13, 95% CI 0.97-1.32, p-value = 0.105).

Our findings indicate the need for a low threshold for skin examination in individuals whose partners have died. What is already known about this topic? Psychological stress has been proposed as a risk factor for the development and progression of cancer, including melanoma, but evidence is conflicting. Clinical evidence is limited by small sample sizes, potential recall bias associated with self-report, and heterogeneous stress definitions. What does this study add? We found a decreased risk of melanoma diagnosis, but increased mortality associated with partner bereavement. While stress might play a role in the progression of melanoma, an alternative explanation is that bereaved people no longer have a close person to help notice skin changes, leading to delayed melanoma detection.

Methods The CALIBER resource of linked electronic health records from primary care, hospitalisations, myocardial infarction registry and cause-specific mortality in the UK was used to assess associations between resting heart rate and 12 fatal and non-fatal coronary, cardiac, cerebral and peripheral vascular cardiovascular diseases and death using Cox proportional hazard models. Results Among 233,970 patients, 29,690 fatal and non-fatal events occurred. Fully adjusted models showed that resting heart rate was not associated in men or women with cerebrovascular events. In men a resting heart rate of 70-79 bpm (29.1% of all men) versus less than 60 bpm was associated with an increased risk of heart failure (hazard ratio (HR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.16), unheralded coronary death (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13-2.41), total cardiovascular events (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.28) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.58). Women with a higher resting heart rate level of 80-89 bpm versus 60 bpm had a higher risk of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07-1.24) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) compared to a resting heart rate less than 60 bpm. The risk was also present at higher heart rates (&gt;90 bpm) for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Conclusions A resting heart rate that clinicians currently consider as 'normal' in the general population is specifically associated with the incidence of certain major cardiovascular diseases and death, with the risk starting at lower resting heart rate levels in men compared to women. Further research is required to evaluate whether interventions to lower resting heart rate are warranted to prevent disease.

We investigated the relationship between troponin level, coronary angiography, and all-cause mortality in real-world patients presenting with AF. Methods and Results We used National Institute of Health Research Health Informatics Collaborative data to identify patients admitted between 2010 and 2017 at 5 tertiary centers in the United Kingdom with a primary diagnosis of AF. Peak troponin results were scaled as multiples of the upper limit of normal. A total of 3121 patients were included in the analysis. Over a median follow-up of 1462 (interquartile range, 929-1975) days, there were 586 deaths (18.8%). The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality associated with a positive troponin (value above upper limit of normal) was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.01-1.43; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05). Higher troponin levels were associated with higher risk of mortality, reaching a maximum hazard ratio of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.9-3.4) at \u2248250 multiples of the upper limit of normal. There was an exponential relationship between higher troponin levels and increased odds of coronary angiography. The mortality risk was 36% lower in patients undergoing coronary angiography than in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.01). Conclusions Increased troponin was associated with increased risk of mortality in patients presenting with AF. The lower hazard ratio in patients undergoing invasive management raises the possibility that the clinical importance of troponin release in AF may be mediated by coronary artery disease, which may be responsive to revascularization.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Kaura A"}, {"clean": "Arnold A"}, {"clean": "Panoulas V"}, {"clean": "Glampson B"}, {"clean": "Davies J"}, {"clean": "Mulla A"}, {"clean": "Woods K"}, {"clean": "Omigie J"}, {"clean": "Shah A"}, {"clean": "Channon K"}, {"clean": "Weber J"}, {"clean": "Thursz M"}, {"clean": "Elliott P"}, {"clean": "Hemingway H"}, {"clean": "Williams B"}, {"clean": "Asselbergs F"}, {"clean": "O'Sullivan M"}, {"clean": "Lord G"}, {"clean": "Melikian N"}, {"clean": "Lefroy D"}, {"clean": "Francis D"}, {"clean": "Shah A"}, {"clean": "Kharbanda R"}, {"clean": "Perera D"}, {"clean": "Patel R"}, {"clean": "Mayet J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J Am Heart Assoc", "volume": "9", "issue": "7"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "NKHCGBHU", "DOI": "10.1002/sim.8503", "DOI_filename": "624c96946d744be8506355a139a4b089", "PMID": "32103533", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85080081984", "hash": "9eb7e3faae12199d4b688d25da1aabcd"}, "clean": {"title": "Propensity scores using missingness pattern information: a practical guide.", "abstract": "[\"Electronic health records are a valuable data source for investigating health-related questions, and propensity score analysis has become an increasingly popular approach to address confounding bias in such investigations. However, because electronic health records are typically routinely recorded as part of standard clinical care, there are often missing values, particularly for potential confounders. In our motivating study-using electronic health records to investigate the effect of renin-angiotensin system blockers on the risk of acute kidney injury-two key confounders, ethnicity and chronic kidney disease stage, have 59% and 53% missing data, respectively. The missingness pattern approach (MPA), a variant of the missing indicator approach, has been proposed as a method for handling partially observed confounders in propensity score analysis. In the MPA, propensity scores are estimated separately for each missingness pattern present in the data. Although the assumptions underlying the validity of the MPA are stated in the literature, it can be difficult in practice to assess their plausibility. In this article, we explore the MPA's underlying assumptions by using causal diagrams to assess their plausibility in a range of simple scenarios, drawing general conclusions about situations in which they are likely to be violated. We present a framework providing practical guidance for assessing whether the MPA's assumptions are plausible in a particular setting and thus deciding when the MPA is appropriate. We apply our framework to our motivating study, showing that the MPA's underlying assumptions appear reasonable, and we demonstrate the application of MPA to this study.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Blake H"}, {"clean": "Leyrat C"}, {"clean": "Mansfield K"}, {"clean": "Seaman S"}, {"clean": "Tomlinson L"}, {"clean": "Carpenter J"}, {"clean": "Williamson E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Stat Med", "volume": "39", "issue": "11"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "NMBHYW9E", "DOI": "10.1007/s10926-019-09867-w", "DOI_filename": "ffff03a7537e773f6b16d9284721f418", "PMID": "31820220", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85076746621", "hash": "fca0de951c56ea5f9bc72b92aaa6a4a2"}, "clean": {"title": "The Association Between Fault Attribution and Work Participation After Road Traffic Injury: A Registry-Based Observational Study.", "abstract": "['Purpose To characterise associations between fault attribution and work participation and capacity after road traffic injury.

Fault profiles from linked compensation claims were defined as no other at fault, another at fault, denied another at fault, claimed another at fault, and unknown.

Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities.', 'We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs.', 'Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40\u00b70% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39\u00b74-40\u00b77) to 50\u00b73% (50\u00b70-50\u00b75), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46\u00b73% (95% UI 46\u00b71-46\u00b75) in 2017, compared with 28\u00b77% (28\u00b75-29\u00b70) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (&gt;80%) in 2017. More than 253\\u2008000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88\u00b76% (95% UI 87\u00b72-89\u00b77) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76\u00b71% (95% UI 71\u00b76-80\u00b77) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53\u00b79% (50\u00b76-59\u00b76) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017.', 'Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed.

The degree variance is an important metric for characterising network degree heterogeneity. Here, we provide an analytically valid normalisation of degree variance to replace previous normalisations which are either invalid or not applicable to all networks. It is shown that this normalisation provides equal values for graphs and their complements; it is maximal in the star graph (and its complement); and its expected value is constant with respect to density for Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graphs of the same size. We strengthen these results with model observations in ER random graphs, random geometric graphs, scale-free networks, random hierarchy networks and resting-state brain networks, showing that the proposed normalisation is generally less affected by both network size and density than previous normalisation attempts. The closed form expression proposed also benefits from high computational efficiency and straightforward mathematical analysis. Analysis of 184 real-world binary networks across different disciplines shows that normalised degree variance is not correlated with average degree and is robust to node and edge subsampling. Comparisons across subdomains of biological networks reveals greater degree heterogeneity among brain connectomes and food webs than in protein interaction networks.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Smith K"}, {"clean": "Escudero J"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Appl Netw Sci", "volume": "5", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "NQFJC8ZJ", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.l6987", "DOI_filename": "97a9f11c3db34933ee3edad0e50eddc4", "PMID": "31969318", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85078227630", "hash": "0e74454827c452f27d8264226c284876"}, "clean": {"title": "Risk of herpes zoster after exposure to varicella to explore the exogenous boosting hypothesis: self controlled case series study using UK electronic healthcare data.", "abstract": "['To assess the magnitude and duration of any hypothesised protective effect of household exposure to a child with varicella on the relative incidence of herpes zoster in adults.', 'Self controlled case series.', 'UK general practices contributing to Clinical Practice Research Datalink.', '9604 adults (\u226518 years) with a diagnosis of herpes zoster (in primary care or hospital records) between 1997 and 2018, who during their observation period lived with a child (&lt;18 years) with a diagnosis of varicella.', 'Relative incidence of herpes zoster in the 20 years after exposure to a child with varicella in the household compared with baseline time (all other time, excluding the 60 days before exposure).', '6584 of the 9604 adults with herpes zoster (68.6%) were women.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 produced updated and comprehensive demographic assessments of the key indicators of fertility, mortality, migration, and population for 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations from 1950 to 2019.', '8078 country-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 938 surveys, 349 censuses, and 238 other sources were identified and used to estimate age-specific fertility. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate age-specific fertility rates for 5-year age groups between ages 15 and 49 years. With extensions to age groups 10-14 and 50-54 years, the total fertility rate (TFR) was then aggregated using the estimated age-specific fertility between ages 10 and 54 years. 7417 sources were used for under-5 mortality estimation and 7355 for adult mortality. ST-GPR was used to synthesise data sources after correction for known biases. Adult mortality was measured as the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years based on vital registration, sample registration, and sibling histories, and was also estimated using ST-GPR. HIV-free life tables were then estimated using estimates of under-5 and adult mortality rates using a relational model life table system created for GBD, which closely tracks observed age-specific mortality rates from complete vital registration when available. Independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated by an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance and other sources were incorporated into the estimates in countries with large epidemics. Annual and single-year age estimates of net migration and population for each country and territory were generated using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model that analysed estimated age-specific fertility and mortality rates along with 1250 censuses and 747 population registry years. We classified location-years into seven categories on the basis of the natural rate of increase in population (calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate) and the net migration rate. We computed healthy life expectancy (HALE) using years lived with disability (YLDs) per capita, life tables, and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty was propagated throughout the demographic estimation process, including fertility, mortality, and population, with 1000 draw-level estimates produced for each metric.', 'The global TFR decreased from 2\u00b772 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2\u00b766-2\u00b779) in 2000 to 2\u00b731 (2\u00b717-2\u00b746) in 2019. Global annual livebirths increased from 134\u00b75 million (131\u00b75-137\u00b78) in 2000 to a peak of 139\u00b76 million (133\u00b70-146\u00b79) in 2016. Global livebirths then declined to 135\u00b73 million (127\u00b72-144\u00b71) in 2019. Of the 204 countries and territories included in this study, in 2019, 102 had a TFR lower than 2\u00b71, which is considered a good approximation of replacement-level fertility. All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27\u00b71% (95% UI 26\u00b74-27\u00b78) of global livebirths. Global life expectancy at birth increased from 67\u00b72 years (95% UI 66\u00b78-67\u00b76) in 2000 to 73\u00b75 years (72\u00b78-74\u00b73) in 2019. The total number of deaths increased from 50\u00b77 million (49\u00b75-51\u00b79) in 2000 to 56\u00b75 million (53\u00b77-59\u00b72) in 2019. Under-5 deaths declined from 9\u00b76 million (9\u00b71-10\u00b73) in 2000 to 5\u00b70 million (4\u00b73-6\u00b70) in 2019. Global population increased by 25\u00b77%, from 6\u00b72 billion (6\u00b70-6\u00b73) in 2000 to 7\u00b77 billion (7\u00b75-8\u00b70) in 2019. In 2019, 34 countries had negative natural rates of increase; in 17 of these, the population declined because immigration was not sufficient to counteract the negative rate of decline. Globally, HALE increased from 58\u00b76 years (56\u00b71-60\u00b78) in 2000 to 63\u00b75 years (60\u00b78-66\u00b71) in 2019. HALE increased in 202 of 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019.', 'Over the past 20 years, fertility rates have been dropping steadily and life expectancy has been increasing, with few exceptions. Much of this change follows historical patterns linking social and economic determinants, such as those captured by the GBD Socio-demographic Index, with demographic outcomes. More recently, several countries have experienced a combination of low fertility and stagnating improvement in mortality rates, pushing more populations into the late stages of the demographic transition.

Models included information on age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol. For derivation, we included participants aged 40-80 years without a known baseline history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed up until the first myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or stroke event.

In this paper, we identify major methodological issues in the standard ways that adherence has been conceptualised, defined and studied in asthma and TB. Between and within the two diseases there are substantial variations in adherence reporting, linked to differences in dosing intervals and treatment duration. Critically, the communicable nature of TB has resulted in dose-by-dose monitoring becoming a recommended treatment standard. Through the lens of these similarities and contrasts, we highlight contemporary shortcomings in the generalised conceptualisation of medication adherence. Furthermore, we outline elements in which knowledge could be directly transferred from one condition to the other, such as the application of large-scale cost-effective monitoring methods in TB to resource-poor settings in asthma. To develop a more robust evidence-based approach, we recommend the use of standard taxonomies detailed in the ABC taxonomy when measuring and discussing adherence. Regimen and intervention development and use should be based on sufficient evidence of the commonality and type of adherence behaviours displayed by patients with the relevant condition.

These results show the power of large-scale blood cell trait GWAS to interrogate clinically meaningful variants across a wide allelic spectrum of human variation.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Vuckovic D"}, {"clean": "Bao E"}, {"clean": "Akbari P"}, {"clean": "Lareau C"}, {"clean": "Mousas A"}, {"clean": "Jiang T"}, {"clean": "Chen M"}, {"clean": "Raffield L"}, {"clean": "Tardaguila M"}, {"clean": "Huffman J"}, {"clean": "Ritchie S"}, {"clean": "Megy K"}, {"clean": "Ponstingl H"}, {"clean": "Penkett C"}, {"clean": "Albers P"}, {"clean": "Wigdor E"}, {"clean": "Sakaue S"}, {"clean": "Moscati A"}, {"clean": "Manansala R"}, {"clean": "Lo K"}, {"clean": "Qian H"}, {"clean": "Akiyama M"}, {"clean": "Bartz T"}, {"clean": "Ben-Shlomo Y"}, {"clean": "Beswick A"}, {"clean": "Bork-Jensen J"}, {"clean": "Bottinger E"}, {"clean": "Brody J"}, {"clean": "van Rooij F"}, {"clean": "Chitrala K"}, {"clean": "Wilson P"}, {"clean": "Choquet H"}, {"clean": "Danesh J"}, {"clean": "Di Angelantonio E"}, {"clean": "Dimou N"}, {"clean": "Ding J"}, {"clean": "Elliott P"}, {"clean": "Esko T"}, {"clean": "Evans M"}, {"clean": "Felix S"}, {"clean": "Floyd J"}, {"clean": "Broer L"}, {"clean": "Grarup N"}, {"clean": "Guo M"}, {"clean": "Guo Q"}, {"clean": "Greinacher A"}, {"clean": "Haessler J"}, {"clean": "Hansen T"}, {"clean": "Howson J"}, {"clean": "Huang W"}, {"clean": "Jorgenson E"}, {"clean": "Kacprowski T"}, {"clean": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M"}, {"clean": "Kamatani Y"}, {"clean": "Kanai M"}, {"clean": "Karthikeyan S"}, {"clean": "Koskeridis F"}, {"clean": "Lange L"}, {"clean": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T"}, {"clean": "Linneberg A"}, {"clean": "Liu Y"}, {"clean": "Lyytik\u00e4inen L"}, {"clean": "Manichaikul A"}, {"clean": "Matsuda K"}, {"clean": "Mohlke K"}, {"clean": "Mononen N"}, {"clean": "Murakami Y"}, {"clean": "Nadkarni G"}, {"clean": "Nikus K"}, {"clean": "Pankratz N"}, {"clean": "Pedersen O"}, {"clean": "Preuss M"}, {"clean": "Psaty B"}, {"clean": "Raitakari O"}, {"clean": "Rich S"}, {"clean": "Rodriguez B"}, {"clean": "Rosen J"}, {"clean": "Rotter J"}, {"clean": "Schubert P"}, {"clean": "Spracklen C"}, {"clean": "Surendran P"}, {"clean": "Tang H"}, {"clean": "Tardif J"}, {"clean": "Ghanbari M"}, {"clean": "V\u00f6lker U"}, {"clean": "V\u00f6lzke H"}, {"clean": "Watkins N"}, {"clean": "Weiss S"}, {"clean": "Cai N"}, {"clean": "Kundu K"}, {"clean": "Watt S"}, {"clean": "Walter K"}, {"clean": "Zonderman A"}, {"clean": "Cho K"}, {"clean": "Li Y"}, {"clean": "Loos R"}, {"clean": "Knight J"}, {"clean": "Georges M"}, {"clean": "Stegle O"}, {"clean": "Evangelou E"}, {"clean": "Okada Y"}, {"clean": "Roberts D"}, {"clean": "Inouye M"}, {"clean": "Johnson A"}, {"clean": "Auer P"}, {"clean": "Astle W"}, {"clean": "Reiner A"}, {"clean": "Butterworth A"}, {"clean": "Ouwehand W"}, {"clean": "Lettre G"}, {"clean": "Sankaran V"}, {"clean": "Soranzo N"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Cell", "volume": "182", "issue": "5"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "RXB9YKBZ", "DOI": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000009924", "DOI_filename": "663ffb70e111b0c0116f016a824dc91c", "PMID": "32616677", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85089358641", "hash": "ec445d1ca77ed326e8c6d39e22eb8092"}, "clean": {"title": "Accuracy of identifying incident stroke cases from linked health care data in UK Biobank.", "abstract": "['In UK Biobank (UKB), a large population-based prospective study, cases of many diseases are ascertained through linkage to routinely collected, coded national health datasets.

We analyzed GWAS on electrocardiographic QRS duration using these two workflows.

These data may be produced during routine clinical processes or obtained directly from the patient using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Although efficiency and other reasons justify data availability for a range of potentially relevant uses, these data are nearly always collected for a single specific purpose. The health care literature reflects this narrow scope, and there is limited literature on the joint use of health data for daily clinical use, clinical research, surveillance, and administrative purposes. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework for discussing the efficient use of health data with a specific focus on the role of PRO measures. PRO data may be used at an individual patient level to inform patient care or shared decision making and to tailor care to individual needs or group-level needs as a complement to health record data, such as that on mortality and readmission, in order to inform service delivery and measure the real-world effectiveness of treatment. PRO measures may be used either for their own sake, to provide valuable information from the patient perspective, or as a proxy for clinical data that would otherwise not be feasible to collect. We introduce a framework to analyze any health care activity that involves health data. The framework consists of four data processes (patient identification, data collection, data aggregation and data use), further structured into two dichotomous dimensions in each data process (level: group vs patient; timeframe: ad hoc vs systematic). This framework is used to analyze various health activities with respect to joint use of data, considering the technical, legal, organizational, and logistical challenges that characterize each data process. Finally, we propose a model for joint use of health data with data collected during follow-up as a base. Demands for health data will continue to increase, which will further add to the need for the concerted use and reuse of PRO data for parallel purposes. Repeated and uncoordinated PRO data collection for the same patient for different purposes results in misuse of resources for the patient and the health care system as well as reduced response rates owing to questionnaire fatigue. PRO data can be routinely collected both at the hospital (from inpatients as well as outpatients) and outside of hospital settings; in primary or social care settings; or in the patient's home, provided the health informatics infrastructure is in place. In the future, clinical settings are likely to be a prominent source of PRO data; however, we are also likely to see increased remote collection of PRO data by patients in their own home (telePRO). Data collection for research and quality surveillance will have to adapt to this circumstance and adopt complementary data capture methods that take advantage of the utility of PRO data collected during daily clinical practice. The European Union's regulation with respect to the protection of personal data-General Data Protection Regulation-imposes severe restrictions on the use of health data for parallel purposes, and steps should be taken to alleviate the consequences while still protecting personal data against misuse.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Data Collection", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Informatics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Records Systems, Computerized", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Physician-Patient Relations", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Hjollund N"}, {"clean": "Valderas J"}, {"clean": "Kyte D"}, {"clean": "Calvert M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "J.

Making progress towards UHC is a policy priority for both countries and global institutions, as highlighted by the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Measuring effective coverage at the health-system level is important for understanding whether health services are aligned with countries' health profiles and are of sufficient quality to produce health gains for populations of all ages.\", \"Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we assessed UHC effective coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Drawing from a measurement framework developed through WHO's GPW13 consultation, we mapped 23 effective coverage indicators to a matrix representing health service types (eg, promotion, prevention, and treatment) and five population-age groups spanning from reproductive and newborn to older adults (\u226565 years). Effective coverage indicators were based on intervention coverage or outcome-based measures such as mortality-to-incidence ratios to approximate access to quality care; outcome-based measures were transformed to values on a scale of 0-100 based on the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentile of location-year values. We constructed the UHC effective coverage index by weighting each effective coverage indicator relative to its associated potential health gains, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years for each location-year and population-age group. For three tests of validity (content, known-groups, and convergent), UHC effective coverage index performance was generally better than that of other UHC service coverage indices from WHO (ie, the current metric for SDG indicator 3.8.1 on UHC service coverage), the World Bank, and GBD 2017. We quantified frontiers of UHC effective coverage performance on the basis of pooled health spending per capita, representing UHC effective coverage index levels achieved in 2019 relative to country-level government health spending, prepaid private expenditures, and development assistance for health. To assess current trajectories towards the GPW13 UHC billion target-1 billion more people benefiting from UHC by 2023-we estimated additional population equivalents with UHC effective coverage from 2018 to 2023.\", 'Globally, performance on the UHC effective coverage index improved from 45\u00b78 (95% uncertainty interval 44\u00b72-47\u00b75) in 1990 to 60\u00b73 (58\u00b77-61\u00b79) in 2019, yet country-level UHC effective coverage in 2019 still spanned from 95 or higher in Japan and Iceland to lower than 25 in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Since 2010, sub-Saharan Africa showed accelerated gains on the UHC effective coverage index (at an average increase of 2\u00b76% [1\u00b79-3\u00b73] per year up to 2019); by contrast, most other GBD super-regions had slowed rates of progress in 2010-2019 relative to 1990-2010. Many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for non-communicable diseases relative to those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, despite non-communicable diseases accounting for a greater proportion of potential health gains in 2019, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising non-communicable disease burden and associated population health needs. In 2019, the UHC effective coverage index was associated with pooled health spending per capita (r=0\u00b779), although countries across the development spectrum had much lower UHC effective coverage than is potentially achievable relative to their health spending. Under maximum efficiency of translating health spending into UHC effective coverage performance, countries would need to reach $1398 pooled health spending per capita (US$ adjusted for purchasing power parity) in order to achieve 80 on the UHC effective coverage index. From 2018 to 2023, an estimated 388\u00b79 million (358\u00b76-421\u00b73) more population equivalents would have UHC effective coverage, falling well short of the GPW13 target of 1 billion more people benefiting from UHC during this time. Current projections point to an estimated 3\u00b71 billion (3\u00b70-3\u00b72) population equivalents still lacking UHC effective coverage in 2023, with nearly a third (968\u00b71 million [903\u00b75-1040\u00b73]) residing in south Asia.', \"The present study demonstrates the utility of measuring effective coverage and its role in supporting improved health outcomes for all people-the ultimate goal of UHC and its achievement. Global ambitions to accelerate progress on UHC service coverage are increasingly unlikely unless concerted action on non-communicable diseases occurs and countries can better translate health spending into improved performance. Focusing on effective coverage and accounting for the world's evolving health needs lays the groundwork for better understanding how close-or how far-all populations are in benefiting from UHC.\",

With effort underway to convert narrative character descriptions to computable data, ontologies for such modifiers are needed. Such ontologies can also be used to guide term usage in future publications. Spatial and method modifiers are the subjects of ontologies that already have been developed or are under development. In this work, frequency (e.g., rarely, usually), certainty (e.g., probably, definitely), degree (e.g., slightly, extremely), and coverage modifiers (e.g., sparsely, entirely) are collected, reviewed, and used to create two modifier ontologies with different design considerations. The basic goal is to express the sequential relationships within a type of modifiers, for example, usually is more frequent than rarely, in order to allow data annotated with ontology terms to be classified accordingly. &lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt; Two designs are proposed for the ontology, both using the list pattern: a closed ordered list (i.e., five-bin design) and an open ordered list design. The five-bin design puts the modifier terms into a set of 5 fixed bins with interval object properties, for example, one_level_more/less_frequently_than, where new terms can only be added as synonyms to existing classes. The open list approach starts with 5 bins, but supports the extensibility of the list via ordinal properties, for example, more/less_frequently_than, allowing new terms to be inserted as a new class anywhere in the list. The consequences of the different design decisions are discussed in the paper. CharaParser was used to extract modifiers from plant, ant, and other taxonomic descriptions. After a manual screening, 130 modifier words were selected as the candidate terms for the modifier ontologies. Four curators/experts (three biologists and one information scientist specialized in biosemantics) reviewed and categorized the terms into 20 bins using the Ontology Term Organizer (OTO) (http://biosemantics.arizona.edu/OTO). Inter-curator variations were reviewed and expressed in the final ontologies. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Frequency, certainty, degree, and coverage terms with complete agreement among all curators were used as class labels or exact synonyms. Terms with different interpretations were either excluded or included using \"broader synonym\" or \"not recommended\" annotation properties. These annotations explicitly allow for the user to be aware of the semantic ambiguity associated with the terms and whether they should be used with caution or avoided. Expert categorization results showed that 16 out of 20 bins contained terms with full agreements, suggesting differentiating the modifiers into 5 levels/bins balances the need to differentiate modifiers and the need for the ontology to reflect user consensus. Two ontologies, developed using the Protege ontology editor, are made available as OWL files and can be downloaded from https://github.com/biosemantics/ontologies. &lt;i&gt;Contribution:&lt;/i&gt; We built the first two modifier ontologies following a consensus-based approach with terms commonly used in taxonomic literature. The five-bin ontology has been used in the Explorer of Taxon Concepts web toolkit to compute the similarity between characters extracted from literature to facilitate taxon concepts alignments. The two ontologies will also be used in an ontology-informed authoring tool for taxonomists to facilitate consistency in modifier term usage.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Endara L"}, {"clean": "Thessen A"}, {"clean": "Cole H"}, {"clean": "Walls R"}, {"clean": "Gkoutos G"}, {"clean": "Cao Y"}, {"clean": "Chong S"}, {"clean": "Cui H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Biodivers Data J", "volume": "", "issue": "6"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "SLD6M4PZ", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-019-51562-6", "DOI_filename": "e6ef5043c75e8915c67bad0aa016e1b2", "PMID": "31628383", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85073533592", "hash": "12da6d4eff8223d7569dacd54549403a"}, "clean": {"title": "Whole genome sequencing of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a high burden tuberculosis region of North West Pakistan.", "abstract": "['Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, is a leading infectious cause of mortality worldwide, including in Pakistan. Drug resistant M. tuberculosis is an emerging threat for TB control, making it important to detect the underlying genetic mutations, and thereby inform treatment decision making and prevent transmission. Whole genome sequencing has emerged as the new diagnostic to reliably predict drug resistance within a clinically relevant time frame, and its deployment will have the greatest impact on TB control in highly endemic regions. To evaluate the mutations leading to drug resistance and to assess for evidence of the transmission of resistant strains, 81\\u2009M. tuberculosis samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (North West Pakistan) were subjected to whole genome sequencing and standard drug susceptibility testing for eleven anti-TB drugs. We found the majority of M. tuberculosis isolates were the CAS/Delhi strain-type (lineage 3; n\\u2009=\\u200957; 70.4%) and multi-drug resistant (MDR; n\\u2009=\\u200962; 76.5%). The most frequent resistance mutations were observed in the katG and rpoB genes, conferring resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin respectively. Mutations were also observed in genes conferring resistance to other first and second-line drugs, including in pncA (pyrazinamide), embB (ethambutol), gyrA (fluoroquinolones), rrs (aminoglycosides), rpsL, rrs and giB (streptomycin) loci. Whilst the majority of mutations have been reported in global datasets, we describe unreported putative resistance markers in katG, ethA (ethionamide), gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones), and pncA. Analysis of the mutations revealed that acquisition of rifampicin resistance often preceded isoniazid in our isolates. We also observed a high proportion (17.6%) of pre-MDR isolates with fluoroquinolone resistance markers, potentially due to unregulated anti-TB drug use. Our isolates were compared to previously sequenced strains from Pakistan in a combined phylogenetic tree analysis. The presence of lineage 2 was only observed in our isolates. Using a cut-off of less than ten genome-wide mutation differences between isolates, a transmission analysis revealed 18\\u2009M. tuberculosis isolates clustering within eight networks, thereby providing evidence of drug-resistant TB transmission in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Overall, we have demonstrated that drug-resistant TB isolates are circulating and transmitted in North West Pakistan. Further, we have shown the usefulness of whole genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool for characterizing M. tuberculosis isolates, which will assist future epidemiological studies and disease control activities in Pakistan.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adolescent", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Antitubercular Agents", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Base Sequence", "major": "N"}, {"term": "DNA, Bacterial", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mutation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pakistan", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Phylogeny", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Whole Genome Sequencing", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Young Adult", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Jabbar A"}, {"clean": "Phelan J"}, {"clean": "de Sessions P"}, {"clean": "Khan T"}, {"clean": "Rahman H"}, {"clean": "Khan S"}, {"clean": "Cantillon D"}, {"clean": "Wildner L"}, {"clean": "Ali S"}, {"clean": "Campino S"}, {"clean": "Waddell S"}, {"clean": "Clark T"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Sci Rep", "volume": "9", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "SRRCE284", "DOI": "10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30298-6", "DOI_filename": "6a7dcd6066183d7c32ca3dbc198a4114", "PMID": "31780306", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85077383438", "hash": "aea1a7a741a4ef5fa7463829201e3da0"}, "clean": {"title": "Pharmacoepidemiology research: delivering evidence about drug safety and effectiveness in mental health.", "abstract": "['Research that provides an evidence base for the pharmacotherapy of people with mental disorders is needed. The abundance of digital data has facilitated pharmacoepidemiology and, in particular, observational research on the effectiveness of real-world medication. Advantages of pharmacoepidemiological research are the availability of large patient samples, and coverage of under-researched subpopulations in their naturalistic conditions. Such research is also cheaper and quicker to do than randomised controlled trials, meaning that issues regarding generic medication, stopping medication (deprescribing), and long-term outcomes are more likely to be addressed. Pharmacoepidemiological methods can also be extended to pharmacovigilance and to aid the development of new purposes for existing drugs. Drawbacks of observational pharmacoepidemiological studies come from the non-randomised nature of treatment selection, leading to confounding by indication. Potential methods for managing this drawback include active comparison groups, within-individual designs, and propensity scoring. Many of the more rigorous pharmacoepidemiology studies have been strengthened through multiple analytical approaches triangulated to improve confidence in inferred causal relationships. With developments in data resources and analytical techniques, it is encouraging that guidelines are beginning to include evidence from robust observational pharmacoepidemiological studies alongside randomised controlled trials. Collaboration between guideline writers and researchers involved in pharmacoepidemiology could help researchers to answer the questions that are important to policy makers and ensure that results are integrated into the evidence base. Further development of statistical and data science techniques, alongside public engagement and capacity building (data resources and researcher base), will be necessary to take full advantage of future opportunities.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mental Disorders", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pharmacoepidemiology", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pharmacovigilance", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Davis K"}, {"clean": "Farooq S"}, {"clean": "Hayes J"}, {"clean": "John A"}, {"clean": "Lee W"}, {"clean": "MacCabe J"}, {"clean": "McIntosh A"}, {"clean": "Osborn D"}, {"clean": "Stewart R"}, {"clean": "Woelbert E"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Lancet Psychiatry", "volume": "7", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "SSWV6K8V", "DOI": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038814", "DOI_filename": "66079eee09a6bc638a08a28c9dde1439", "PMID": "31234639", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85070183817", "hash": "8fc7ece168c67b2b34fc4414ea3a4e58"}, "clean": {"title": "Use of Genetic Variants Related to Antihypertensive Drugs to Inform on Efficacy and Side Effects.", "abstract": "['Drug effects can be investigated through natural variation in the genes for their protein targets.

Risk prediction typically includes risk factors such as age, sex, family history of disease and lifestyle (e.g. smoking status); however, in recent years, there has been increasing interest to include genomic information into risk models. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants across the human genome into a single score and have recently been shown to have predictive value for multiple common diseases. In this review, we summarize the potential use cases for seven common diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease) where PRS has or could have clinical utility. PRS analysis for these diseases frequently revolved around (i) risk prediction performance of a PRS alone and in combination with other non-genetic risk factors, (ii) estimation of lifetime risk trajectories, (iii) the independent information of PRS and family history of disease or monogenic mutations and (iv) estimation of the value of adding a PRS to specific clinical risk prediction scenarios. We summarize open questions regarding PRS usability, ancestry bias and transferability, emphasizing the need for the next wave of studies to focus on the implementation and health-economic value of PRS testing.

The purpose of our work is to develop and evaluate a system that can identify combinations of alleles underlying digenic and oligogenic diseases in individual whole exome or whole genome sequences. Information that links patient phenotypes to databases of gene-phenotype associations observed in clinical or non-human model organism research can provide useful information and improve variant prioritization for genetic diseases. Additional background knowledge about interactions between genes can be utilized to identify sets of variants in different genes in the same individual which may then contribute to the overall disease phenotype. We have developed OligoPVP, an algorithm that can be used to prioritize causative combinations of variants in digenic and oligogenic diseases, using whole exome or whole genome sequences together with patient phenotypes as input. We demonstrate that OligoPVP has significantly improved performance when compared to state of the art pathogenicity detection methods in the case of digenic diseases. Our results show that OligoPVP can efficiently prioritize sets of variants in digenic diseases using a phenotype-driven approach and identify etiologically important variants in whole genomes. OligoPVP naturally extends to oligogenic disease involving interactions between variants in two or more genes. It can be applied to the identification of multiple interacting candidate variants contributing to phenotype, where the action of modifier genes is suspected from pedigree analysis or failure of traditional causative variant identification.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Computational Biology", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Association Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Multifactorial Inheritance", "major": "Y"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Boudellioua I"}, {"clean": "Kulmanov M"}, {"clean": "Schofield P"}, {"clean": "Gkoutos G"}, {"clean": "Hoehndorf R"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Sci Rep", "volume": "8", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "TGIPRC9M", "DOI": "10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.029042", "DOI_filename": "b822448a5099aeb7912b5082bdbbdde6", "PMID": "32576090", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85088848525", "hash": "5d5d2a8c57ecadcd672323c7aefd07cb"}, "clean": {"title": "Telemedicine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety After Stroke: Proof-of-Concept Randomized Controlled Trial.", "abstract": "['Disabling anxiety affects a quarter of stroke survivors but access to treatment is poor.

We also discuss some of the challenges these new approaches will bring.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Skinner A"}, {"clean": "Toumpakari Z"}, {"clean": "Stone C"}, {"clean": "Johnson L"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Front Nutr", "volume": "7", "issue": ""}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "TSJRDTYW", "DOI": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31404-5", "DOI_filename": "3006767b6fd01c85f474ac90ffadb0cc", "PMID": "33069324", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85092708402", "hash": "eced05a43569870f75d907be39792fc6"}, "clean": {"title": "Five insights from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.", "abstract": "['The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a rules-based synthesis of the available evidence on levels and trends in health outcomes, a diverse set of risk factors, and health system responses. GBD 2019 covered 204 countries and territories, as well as first administrative level disaggregations for 22 countries, from 1990 to 2019. Because GBD is highly standardised and comprehensive, spanning both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, and uses a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of hierarchical disease and injury causes, the study provides a powerful basis for detailed and broad insights on global health trends and emerging challenges. GBD 2019 incorporates data from 281\\u2008586 sources and provides more than 3\u00b75 billion estimates of health outcome and health system measures of interest for global, national, and subnational policy dialogue. All GBD estimates are publicly available and adhere to the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. From this vast amount of information, five key insights that are important for health, social, and economic development strategies have been distilled. These insights are subject to the many limitations outlined in each of the component GBD capstone papers.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Birth Rate", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Delivery of Health

Moreover, several genes induced during pathological hypertrophy were also found to be increased in human heart failure, with their expression positively correlating to the known stress markers NPPB and MYH7.

However, there is no single widely-accepted standard pipeline for analyzing functional connectivity. The common procedure for designing functional connectivity based predictive models entails three main steps: parcellating the brain, estimating the interaction between defined parcels, and lastly, using these integrated associations between brain parcels as features fed to a classifier for predicting non-imaging variables e.g., behavioural traits, demographics, emotional measures, etc. There are also additional considerations when using correlation-based measures of functional connectivity, resulting in three supplementary steps: utilising Riemannian geometry tangent space parameterization to preserve the geometry of functional connectivity; penalizing the connectivity estimates with shrinkage approaches to handle challenges related to short time-series (and noisy) data; and removing confounding variables from brain-behaviour data. These six steps are contingent on each-other, and to optimise a general framework one should ideally examine these various methods simultaneously. In this paper, we investigated strengths and short-comings, both independently and jointly, of the following measures: parcellation techniques of four kinds (categorized further depending upon number of parcels), five measures of functional connectivity, the decision of staying in the ambient space of connectivity matrices or in tangent space, the choice of applying shrinkage estimators, six alternative techniques for handling confounds and finally four novel classifiers/predictors.

Based on these findings and recent literature, we modelled 40% and 80% of cancer patients being affected by the pandemic in the long-term. At 40% affected, we estimated 1-year total (direct and indirect) excess deaths in people with cancer as between 7165 and 17 910, using RRs of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, where 78% of excess deaths occured in patients with \u22651 comorbidity.', 'Dramatic reductions were detected in the demand for, and supply of, cancer services which have not fully recovered with lockdown easing. These may contribute, over a 1-year time horizon, to substantial excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity. It is urgent to understand how the recovery of general practitioner, oncology and other hospital services might best mitigate these long-term excess mortality risks.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Adult", "major": "N"}, {"term": "COVID-19", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cause of Death", "major": "N"}, {"term": "England", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Female", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Follow-Up Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Male", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Middle Aged", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Multimorbidity", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Neoplasms", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Pandemics", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Population Surveillance", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "SARS-CoV-2", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Survival Rate", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Time Factors", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Lai A"}, {"clean": "Pasea L"}, {"clean": "Banerjee A"}, {"clean": "Hall G"}, {"clean": "Denaxas S"}, {"clean": "Chang W"}, {"clean": "Katsoulis M"}, {"clean": "Williams B"}, {"clean": "Pillay D"}, {"clean": "Noursadeghi M"}, {"clean": "Linch D"}, {"clean": "Hughes D"}, {"clean": "Forster M"}, {"clean": "Turnbull C"}, {"clean": "Fitzpatrick N"}, {"clean": "Boyd K"}, {"clean": "Foster G"}, {"clean": "Enver T"}, {"clean": "Nafilyan V"}, {"clean": "Humberstone B"}, {"clean": "Neal R"}, {"clean": "Cooper M"}, {"clean": "Jones M"}, {"clean": "Pritchard-Jones K"}, {"clean": "Sullivan R"}, {"clean": "Davie C"}, {"clean": "Lawler M"}, {"clean": "Hemingway H"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ Open", "volume": "10", "issue": "11"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "WISM8YIL", "DOI": "10.1111/cen.13990", "DOI_filename": "f8d8d2ad0d45c4404847c332986a2489", "PMID": "30993728", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85066040175", "hash": "3ccfde176ce40912ba2517ed920288cb"}, "clean": {"title": "Risk of incident circulatory disease in patients treated for differentiated thyroid carcinoma with no history of cardiovascular disease.", "abstract": "['The incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is increasing, yet the prognosis is favourable and long-term survival is expected.

We therefore performed a systematic investigation of causal relationships between circulating lipids and cardiovascular outcomes using a Mendelian randomization approach.', 'In the primary analysis, we performed 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization using data from participants of European ancestry. We also conducted univariable analyses using inverse-variance weighted and robust methods, and gene-specific analyses using variants that can be considered as proxies for specific lipid-lowering medications.

This roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policymakers, and has three parts: (i) improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; (ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; and (iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries.

Susceptibility to AD is considerably determined by genetic factors which hitherto were primarily identified using case-control designs. Elucidating the genetic architecture of additional AD-related phenotypic traits, ideally those linked to the underlying disease process, holds great promise in gaining deeper insights into the genetic basis of AD and in developing better clinical prediction models. To this end, we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data in 931 participants of the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) sample to search for novel genetic determinants of AD biomarker variability. Specifically, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses on 16 traits, including 14 measures derived from quantifications of five separate amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau-protein species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to confirming the well-established effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) on diagnostic outcome and phenotypes related to A\u03b242, we detected novel potential signals in the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) for CSF-A\u03b238 and CSF-A\u03b240 levels, and confirmed the previously described sex-specific association between SNPs in geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and CSF-tau. Utilizing the results from independent case-control AD GWAS to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) revealed that AD risk variants only explain a small fraction of CSF biomarker variability. In conclusion, our study represents a detailed first account of GWAS analyses on CSF-A\u03b2 and -tau-related traits in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset.

The SNOMED CT nomenclature potentially offers the means to model such information at scale, yet given a sufficiently large body of clinical text collected over many years, it is difficult to identify the language that clinicians favour to express concepts. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; By utilising a large corpus of healthcare data, we sought to make use of semantic modelling and clustering techniques to represent the relationship between the clinical vocabulary of internationally recognised SMI symptoms and the preferred language used by clinicians within a care setting. We explore how such models can be used for discovering novel vocabulary relevant to the task of phenotyping Serious Mental Illness (SMI) with only a small amount of prior knowledge.\\xa0 &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; 20 403 terms were derived and curated via a two stage methodology. The list was reduced to 557 putative concepts based on eliminating redundant information content.

However, morphological assessment is heavily constrained by a reliance on subjective, qualitative, and poorly reproducible criteria. To improve the morphological assessment of MPNs, we have developed a machine learning approach for the automated identification, quantitative analysis, and abstract representation of megakaryocyte features using reactive/nonneoplastic BMT samples (n = 43) and those from patients with established diagnoses of essential thrombocythemia (n = 45), polycythemia vera (n = 18), or myelofibrosis (n = 25).

Subsequent analysis enabled the tissue diagnosis of MPN with a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.95) and revealed clear evidence of the potential to discriminate between important MPN subtypes. Our method of visually representing abstracted megakaryocyte features in the context of analyzed patient cohorts facilitates the interpretation and monitoring of samples in a manner that is beyond conventional approaches. The automated BMT phenotyping approach described here has significant potential as an adjunct to standard genetic and molecular testing in established or suspected MPN patients, either as part of the routine diagnostic pathway or in the assessment of disease progression/response to treatment.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Sirinukunwattana K"}, {"clean": "Aberdeen A"}, {"clean": "Theissen H"}, {"clean": "Sousos N"}, {"clean": "Psaila B"}, {"clean": "Mead A"}, {"clean": "Turner G"}, {"clean": "Rees G"}, {"clean": "Rittscher J"}, {"clean": "Royston D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Blood Adv", "volume": "4", "issue": "14"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "YCPPCWWE", "DOI": "10.1016/j.burns.2020.01.005", "DOI_filename": "3d6e8115c733e4585b3eab2dded46200", "PMID": "32811694", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85089443339", "hash": "f676fff8af44c4e24deda9637a1a300e"}, "clean": {"title": "Driving improved burns care and patient outcomes through clinical registry data: A review of quality indicators in the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand.", "abstract": "['In 2009, the Burns Registry of Australia and New Zealand (BRANZ) published a set of clinical quality indicators (QIs) to monitor performance, improve quality of care, and inform and change policy.

Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Decision Making", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Disease Outbreaks", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epidemics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epidemiologic Methods", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Forecasting", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Statistical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Models, Theoretical", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Sierra Leone", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Time", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Funk S"}, {"clean": "Camacho A"}, {"clean": "Kucharski A"}, {"clean": "Lowe R"}, {"clean": "Eggo R"}, {"clean": "Edmunds W"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "PLoS Comput.

The complete system, using all eight workflows, would take up to a month, as it includes multi-dimensional NMR experiments that require prolonged experiment times. However, easier identification cases using fewer steps would take 2 or 3 days. This approach to biomarker discovery is efficient and cost-effective and offers increased chemical space coverage of the metabolome, resulting in faster and more accurate assignment of NMR-generated biomarkers arising from metabolic phenotyping studies.

While many of the rules in our pipeline were tailored to extract epilepsy specific information, our methods can be applied to other diseases and also can be used in clinical practice to record patient information in a structured manner.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Algorithms", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Electroencephalography", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Electronic Health Records", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Epilepsy", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Information Storage and Retrieval", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Medical Records", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Natural Language Processing", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Seizures", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Wales", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Fonferko-Shadrach B"}, {"clean": "Lacey A"}, {"clean": "Roberts A"}, {"clean": "Akbari A"}, {"clean": "Thompson S"}, {"clean": "Ford D"}, {"clean": "Lyons R"}, {"clean": "Rees M"}, {"clean": "Pickrell W"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "BMJ Open", "volume": "9", "issue": "4"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ZXA5X442", "DOI": "10.1121/1.5100272", "DOI_filename": "910c8eb2876e2864b08fb5f38966593c", "PMID": "31153319", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85065624341", "hash": "82c297b76b8ed084d8e64d5c00d7eba0"}, "clean": {"title": "Developing a large scale population screening tool for the assessment of Parkinson's disease using telephone-quality voice.", "abstract": "[\"Recent studies have demonstrated that analysis of laboratory-quality voice recordings can be used to accurately differentiate people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) from healthy controls (HCs). These findings could help facilitate the development of remote screening and monitoring tools for PD. In this study, 2759 telephone-quality voice recordings from 1483 PD and 15\\u2009321 recordings from 8300 HC participants were analyzed. To account for variations in phonetic backgrounds, data were acquired from seven countries. A statistical framework for analyzing voice was developed, whereby 307 dysphonia measures that quantify different properties of voice impairment, such as breathiness, roughness, monopitch, hoarse voice quality, and exaggerated vocal tremor, were computed. Feature selection algorithms were used to identify robust parsimonious feature subsets, which were used in combination with a random forests (RFs) classifier to accurately distinguish PD from HC. The best tenfold cross-validation performance was obtained using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and RF, leading to mean sensitivity of 64.90% (standard deviation, SD, 2.90%) and mean specificity of 67.96% (SD 2.90%).

To test this, we examined the overlap between cis-acting elements of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and cancer-susceptibility polymorphisms as defined in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In renal cancer, where HIF is constitutively and un-physiologically activated by mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor, we observed marked excess overlap, which extended to potential susceptibility polymorphisms that are below the conventional threshold applied in GWAS. In contrast, in other cancers where HIF is upregulated by different mechanisms, including micro-environmental hypoxia, we observed no excess in overlap. Our findings support a 'pathway tuning' model of cancer, whereby precise modulation of multiple outputs of specific, activated pathways is important in oncogenesis. This implies that selective pressures to modulate such pathways operate during cancer development and should focus attempts to identify their nature and consequences.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Carcinogenesis", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Cell Line, Tumor", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Datasets as Topic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genome-Wide Association Study", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Kidney Neoplasms", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Mutation", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Signal Transduction", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein", "major": "N"}], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Schmid V"}, {"clean": "Lafleur V"}, {"clean": "Lombardi O"}, {"clean": "Li R"}, {"clean": "Salama R"}, {"clean": "Colli L"}, {"clean": "Choudhry H"}, {"clean": "Chanock S"}, {"clean": "Ratcliffe P"}, {"clean": "Mole D"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Sci Rep", "volume": "9", "issue": "1"}}}, {"IDs": {"zotero": "ZYACFWHH", "DOI": "10.1111/bjd.18046", "DOI_filename": "451c0a5b6bdde6be3afdf0092da55873", "PMID": "31021418", "scopus": "2-s2.0-85070295111", "hash": "15c901663330a8d44c55921384483652"}, "clean": {"title": "'It's like the bad guy in a movie who just doesn't die': a\u00a0qualitative exploration of young people's adaptation to\u00a0eczema and implications for self-care.", "abstract": "[\"Eczema is a common childhood inflammatory skin condition, affecting more than one in five children. A popular perception is that children 'outgrow eczema', although epidemiological studies have shown that, for many, eczema follows a lifelong episodic course.\", 'To explore the perceptions of young people about the nature of their eczema and how these perceptions relate to their self-care and adapting to living with eczema.', 'This is a secondary inductive thematic analysis of interviews conducted for Healthtalk.org. In total 23 interviews with young people with eczema were included. Of the 23 participants, 17 were female and six male, ranging from 17 to 25 years old.', \"Participants generally experienced eczema as an episodic long-term condition and reported a mismatch between information received about eczema and their experiences. The experience of eczema as long term and episodic had implications for self-care, challenging the process of identifying triggers of eczema flare-ups and evaluating the success of treatment regimens. Participants' experiences of eczema over time also had implications for adaptation and finding a balance between accepting eczema as long term and hoping it would go away. This linked to a gradual shift in treatment expectations from 'cure' to 'control' of eczema.\", \"For young people who continue to experience eczema beyond childhood, a greater focus on self-care for a long-term condition may be helpful. Greater awareness of the impact of early messages around 'growing out of' eczema and provision of high-quality information may help patients to manage expectations and support adaptation to treatment regimens. What's already known about this topic? There is a common perception that people 'grow out of' eczema, but for many people eczema follows a lifelong episodic course. Qualitative work has shown that parents can find that being told their child will grow out of eczema is dismissive, and that they have difficulty with messages about 'control not cure' of eczema. It is unclear how young people perceive their eczema and the implications of this perception for their adaptation and self-care. What does this study add? The message that many people 'grow out of' eczema has a potentially detrimental effect for young people where the condition persists. This has implications for young people's perceptions of their eczema, their learning to self-care and how they adapt to living with eczema and eczema treatments. What are the clinical implications of this work? Clinicians need to promote awareness among young people that eczema is a long-term episodic condition in order to engage them with effective self-care. Young people transitioning to self-care need evidence-based information that is specific and relatable to them.\"]", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": [{"clean": "Ghio D"}, {"clean": "Muller I"}, {"clean": "Greenwell K"}, {"clean": "Roberts A"}, {"clean": "McNiven A"}, {"clean": "Langan S"}, {"clean": "Santer M"}], "journal": {"journal_name": "Br J Dermatol", "volume": "182", "issue": "1"}}}];
