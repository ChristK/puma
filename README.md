###Institute###
Names of institutes change all the time (especially over the lifetime of long studies like cohort studies). Then there are the many different spellings and formats of an institution name that people put on papers. In order to merge all of these together a CSV file is used that has all the different spellings mapped to a canonical institute name. It is a manual step to generate this list, and will probably require running the program a few times - adding to the list incrementally.

###Geocoding###
Using the canonical institute name a geocode can be assigned - this is another CSV that has been manually generated.
